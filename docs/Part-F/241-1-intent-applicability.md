## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **single, didactic page template** for cross‑domain worked examples that makes every claim **local to a Context** (Context), every Cross‑context step **explicit via a Bridge**, and every named role/status **traceably tied** to one **SenseCell**. The template is **notation‑free** and **tool‑agnostic**; it captures **how to think** the example so others can replay it.

**Applicability.** Use whenever you illustrate **any** FPF construct that spans more than one Context: **Role Assignment & Enactment** bindings, acceptance checks, measurement-driven claims, type alignment, control/actuation stories, etc.

**Non‑goals.** No registries, workflows, editors, or storage formats; no step‑by‑step “team procedures.” This pattern shapes **the page a reader sees**, not how it was produced.
