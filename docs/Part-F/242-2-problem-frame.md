## 2 · Problem frame

Cross‑domain examples often fail in four predictable ways:

1. **Global words.** *Process*, *role*, *service*, *execution* used without the Context, inviting drift.
2. **Hidden bridges.** “It’s basically the same” across disciplines, with losses left implicit.
3. **Name without sense.** A **Role Description** name appears with no visible tie to a SenseCell.
4. **List without structure.** Facts line up but never meet in a single **Concept‑Set row**.

The template counters these by forcing **Contexts → senses → row → bridges**, in that order.
