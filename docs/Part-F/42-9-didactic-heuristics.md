## 9 · Didactic heuristics (informative)

* **Keep the Context prefix in your inner speech.** Say “*process (BPMN)*”, “*activity (PROV)*”.
* **Prefer head nouns.** If the canon says “service‑level objective”, do not shorten it to “objective”.
* **Resist elegance that erases signal.** Hyphens and case often carry the Context’s culture; keep them.
* **Gloss from use, not from opinion.** Quote in your mind, then compress; avoid importing definitions from neighbouring Contexts.
