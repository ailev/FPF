# B.5.2.1 — Creative Abduction with NQD (binding) \[A]

**Status.** Normative **binding** to **B.5.2 Abductive Loop** that delegates candidate generation to **Γ_nqd.generate** (**C.18 NQD-CAL**) and exploration/exploitation policy to **E/E-LOG (C.19)**; the kernel remains unchanged.

**Non‑duplication & parsimony.** “Introduces **no new kernel primitives**; reuses the CHR kit (**A.17/A.18**) to define measurable **Characteristics**. This pattern does not introduce new eligibility conditions. Application is permitted only when USM coverage holds for the target slice and the performer’s RSG state is enactable (eligibility), without prescribing any team workflow. Per **A.11 Ontological Parsimony**, only a context‑local CHR import and a **Method** are added; **no changes to Γ/LOG**. All generation is performed via **Γ_nqd.* (C.18)** and all exploration/exploitation control via **E/E-LOG (C.19)**. 
**Terminology discipline.** Use **NQD** consistently (Novelty–Quality–Diversity). Treat **S**/**I** as *secondary* metrics unless explicitly promoted by policy (see §3, §5).

**Context**
* **Conceptual binding:** **B.5.2 Abductive Loop** (this pattern specifies the *how* for Steps 2–3).
* **Architheory anchor:** a domain‑neutral **Creativity‑CHR** (C‑cluster) that declares the **Characteristics** used here (see §2). (No change to Γ/LOG.) This binding also references **C.18 NQD-CAL** (operators Γ_nqd.*) and **C.19 E/E-LOG** (EmitterPolicy).
* **Manager’s mental model (informative):** “We add measurable characteristics for *newness*, *spread*, and *fit*, then use a generator that explores widely and returns a **Pareto set** (not a single winner) of non‑dominated options.”
* **Operational loops:** compatible with **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** (ideas generated here flow into Run→Observe→Refine→Deploy) and with **B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle** (ADI), preserving abductive primacy. 
* **Agency note.** Decisions are taken by a **system in role**. **Contexts publish** measurement spaces and admissible policies as **semantic frames**; they do **not** enact choices.
