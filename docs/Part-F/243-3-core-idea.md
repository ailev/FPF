## 3 · Core idea (didactic)

A robust worked example is a **compact theatre**:

* **Stage** = a declared **unification line** (which threads of Part C are in play).
* **Backdrop** = **Context set** (Contexts from F.1), each with a one‑line Card.
* **Actors** = **SenseCells** (⟨Context, Local‑Sense⟩) you will actually use.
* **Plot** = **one Concept‑Set row** where those cells stand as “the same thing” for this example.
* **Cues** = **Role Descriptions** that reference exactly one SenseCell each.
* **Cross‑talk** = **Bridges** across Contexts (with kind, CL, and loss).
* **Timing** = **Windows** (if status varies across time/scale) and **SoD** (if duties must remain separate).
* **Moral** = a handful of **harness checks** (F.15) that the reader can verify mentally.
