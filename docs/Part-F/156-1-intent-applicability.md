## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **notation‑free, Context‑aware map** that keeps four notions distinct and connectable:

* **`U.Method`** — the abstract **way of doing** (design‑time concept).
* **`U.MethodDescription`** — the **recipe** that describes a Method (epistemic artefact).
* **`U.Work`** (informal: *Execution*) — the **run‑time occurrence** of doing (recorded event).
* **`U.Actuation`** — the **control output** applied to a plant (domain‑specific Work in Sys‑CAL).

The pattern makes the split **usable across architheories** (Role Assignment & Enactment, Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, planned LCA-CAL) and **legible across Contexts** (SPEM/BPMN for design; PROV-O/SOSA for run; IEC 61131-3/state-space for control).

**Applicability.** Any time a discussion risks **mixing designs with executions**, **recipes with runs**, or **workflow with control signals**; whenever you need to **name** or **reason** about “how we do X”, “the SOP/script/model”, “the actual run”, or “the actuator push”.

**Non‑goals.** No team workflow, no editors, no tools. No prescriptive file formats. **Only** conceptual distinctions and safe reasoning moves.
