## 12 · Anti‑patterns & how to fix them  \[I/A]

> *Use this section as a “red flags” sheet in reviews. Each item links to a concrete remedy that preserves F–G–R & USM discipline (F/G/R separation, USM algebra, typed pre‑checks).*

| Anti‑pattern (what goes wrong)                                   | Why it’s wrong (conceptual fault)                                                               | The fix (normative/informative pointers)                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“We widened G because we reworded the type.”**                 | Confuses **describedEntity** (kind) with **applicability** (scope). Abstract wording ≠ broader scope. | Keep typed pre‑check separate (C.3.1 `⊑` or C.3.3 KindBridge). Widen **G** only via **ΔG+** with support (USM A.2.6).                                 |
| **“Kind scope” block attached to a Kind.**                       | Kinds don’t carry Scope; they carry **intent/extent**.                                          | Remove the block. Scope stays on claims/capabilities (USM). If you meant classifier definedness, state it via **K‑07** (C.3.2).                       |
| **Inferring scope from extension size.**                         | **Scope ≠ Extension**; extension is “which instances in a slice,” not “where the claim holds.”  | Keep **G** set‑valued over `U.ContextSlice` (USM). Use `MemberOf` only inside the typed quantifier.                                                   |
| **Mask used as a hidden kind (“just call it the masked kind”).** | Opaque drift; reviewers can’t see constraints.                                                  | Register a **RoleMask** (C.3.4). If reused across guards, **promote to subkind** with `⊑`.                                                            |
| **Cross‑context reuse with only one bridge.**                       | Contexts differ on two characteristics: Scope **and** Kind.                                                   | Apply the **two‑bridge rule**: Scope Bridge (**CL** → Φ) **and** KindBridge (**`CL^k`** → Ψ). Both penalties land in **R**.                           |
| **Using AT (K0…K3) as a gate/threshold.**                        | AT is an **informative facet**, not a Characteristic; gating on AT recreates a G‑ladder.        | Remove AT from guards. Use it only to **aim ΔF/ΔR** and to set **bridge expectations** (C.3.5).                                                       |
| **“Automated execution success proves the type claim.”**                            | Execution success (F5/6) is not proof (F7+); also confuses **R** with **F**.                    | If you need proof‑grade properties, raise **F** for the claim/KindSignature (C.2.3) or restrict the claim. Keep **R** as evidence freshness/coverage. |
| **Hidden “latest” in membership or scope checks.**               | Non‑deterministic evaluation; unverifiable audit trail.                                         | Declare **Γ\_time** explicitly in Scope (USM). Membership must be **deterministic** (C.3.2 K‑05/K‑07).                                                |
| **Fixing type mismatch by “unioning scopes.”**                   | G‑union cannot repair **describedEntity** mismatches.                                                 | Introduce a **subkind**, add an **adapter** (+evidence), or define a **KindBridge**.                                                                  |
| **Collapsing subkinds silently in a bridge.**                    | Reviewers don’t see lost distinctions → false confidence.                                       | Record **loss notes** on the KindBridge (C.3.3 KB‑11); consider **narrowing** mapped Scope or adding an adapter.                                      |
