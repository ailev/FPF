## 6 · Solution — the control cabinet (conceptual, notation‑free)

### 6.1 Reuse by row (first lever)

* **Move.** If a proposal matches the **intension** of an existing row (F.7), adopt its Role Description or add a local SenseCell **inside that row**.
* **Pay‑off.** Names don’t proliferate; Cross‑context tables stay thin.

**Example (services).** *Service‑availability‑compliance* already exists as a row. New labels *SLO‑Met* / *Uptime‑OK* **reuse** that row; SOSA/SSN Observations later feed it (F.12).

### 6.2 Bundle instead of hybrid (second lever)

* **Move.** When practice always pairs two Roles, define a **Bundle** `{RoleA, RoleB}`.
* **Not a hybrid.** Do **not** coin *RoleAB*; you’ll erase SoD options and obscure responsibilities.

**Example (enactment).** `{Requester, Approver}` is a Bundle. *Request‑Approver* (one Role) is **not** allowed; it contradicts intended checks.

---

### 6.3 Separate by SoD, don’t evade (third lever)

* **Move.** Record **SoD constraints** where separation matters (“Requester ⟂ Approver in run window”).
* **Why here.** SoD belongs to **semantics**, not org policy; it protects structure across Contexts and times.

**Example (methods).** `{Author ⟂ Reviewer}` in the **review window**. A proposal *Senior‑Reviewer* to “do both” is rejected; the **Bundle** remains `{Author, Reviewer}` with SoD.

---

### 6.4 Window the Status (fourth lever)

* **Move.** Keep a single Status and attach **windows** for *grace*, *evaluation*, *active*, *archival*.
* **Avoid.** *Compliant*, *At‑Risk*, *Grace* as separate Status types.

**Example (acceptance).** **Compliance** Status has readings per window:

* *evaluation window:* “pending check”,
* *active window:* “met / breached”,
* *grace window:* “temporarily tolerated breach”.
  One Status; clear windows.

---

### 6.5 Factor modifiers as facets, not names

* **Move.** Treat qualifiers (shift, locality, domain) as **facets** of the same Role/Status or as **windows**, not new types.

**Example (operations).** *Operator* with **window facet** `timeOfDay = night`—not a new Role *Night‑Operator*.
