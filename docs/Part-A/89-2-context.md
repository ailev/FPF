* **Holonic substrate.** FPF separates *what things are* (Holon → {System, Episteme, …}) from *what they are being right now* via **roles**. Only **systems** can bear **behavioural** roles and execute methods/work; epistemes are changed **via their symbol carriers**.
* **Role as mask; behaviour as method/work.** A role is a **mask**, not behaviour; behaviour is a **Method** (order‑sensitive capability) that may be executed as **Work** (dated occurrence).
* **Design‑time vs run‑time.** A holon’s states belong to disjoint scopes **Tᴰ** and **Tᴿ**; transitions are physically grounded by a system bearing **TransformerRole**.
* **Evidence & carriers.** Claims about outcomes must anchor to **carriers** (SCR/RSCR) and to an **external** evidencing transformer.
