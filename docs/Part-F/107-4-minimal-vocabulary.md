## 4 · Minimal vocabulary (used in this pattern only)

* **Context** — `U.BoundedContext` (per D.CTX).
* **SenseCell** — address of a **local sense** produced by F.3 (one context × one clustered sense).
* **Concept‑Set row** — a **licensed Cross‑context reading** (F.7) of cells in one senseFamily with a declared **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**.
* **senseFamily** — as defined in **F.0.1**; here used as the **typed discriminator for rows** restricted to {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. 
* **Role Description** — a **Role/Status** template anchored to a **single SenseCell** (F.4).
* **Alias** — an **additional label** for an existing FPF label (within F.5), no new semantics.
* **CL threshold τ(scope)** — the **minimum congruence level** needed for a row’s scope (e.g., τ(Naming-only) < τ(Assignment-eligibility) < τ(Type-structure)).
