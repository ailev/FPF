## 9 · Self‑checks (mental probes)

* **Same‑conclusion test.** Do two candidate senses ever lead to **different conclusions** in the canon? If not, merge.
* **Argument‑slot probe.** Replace arguments in canonical sentences; do both candidates still read true? If one fails, split.
* **Label inversion.** Read the Plain label alone: does it tempt you to over‑generalise? If yes, tighten it.
* **Counter‑example ping.** Can you state a **ten‑word** use that the sense must exclude? If you can, write it; if you cannot, your sense may be too broad.
* **Memory rule.** Can you recall the Context’s Local‑Senses **without notes**? If not, you split too finely.
