## 1 · Context (plain‑language motivation)

Projects need a **stable way to express “how it is written”**—the recipe, code, SOP, rule set, or formal proof—**without confusing it** with:

* the **semantic “way of doing”** (that is `U.Method`),
* the **assignment** (that is `U.RoleAssignment`),
* the **ability** (that is `U.Capability`),
* the **execution** (that is `U.Work`), or
* the **calendar plan** (that is `U.WorkPlan`).

`U.MethodDescription` gives this anchor. It treats **algorithms, programs, proofs, SOPs, BPMN diagrams, solver models, playbooks** as **one class of epistemes**: *knowledge on a carrier that describes a Method*. This unifies software and “paper” procedures and lets teams switch notations without breaking the model.
