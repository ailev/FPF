## 3) Forces

| Force                                       | Tension we must resolve                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generativity vs Assurance**               | Open‑ended idea generation must not erode safety/traceability.                    |
| **SoTA speed vs Canon stability**           | Frequent small updates must preserve conceptual integrity and roll‑up invariants. |
| **Local meaning vs Global reuse**           | Context‑local meaning must cross contexts only via **Bridges** with CL penalties. |
| **Notational independence vs Checkability** | Text must stay notation‑free yet be verifiable by Tooling harnesses.              |
