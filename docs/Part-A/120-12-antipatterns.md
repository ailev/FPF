## 12 · Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **Spec = run.** “Yesterday’s process log is our spec.” → The log is **Work**; write a **MethodDescription** and link runs to it.
* **Who/time in the spec.** “Step 3 by Alice at 02:00 daily.” → Use **RoleAssigning** at run time; schedule via **WorkPlan**.
* **Stuffing BoM.** Listing parts/assemblies inside the spec. → Reference **interfaces/resources**; keep PBS/SBS separate.
* **Algorithm‑only bias.** Treating code as “real spec” and SOPs as “notes.” → Both are **MethodDescription**; judge by Standards, not by format.
* **Hiding non‑determinism.** Solver model with no acceptance criteria. → Declare admissible outcome set and tests.
* **Silent parameter capture.** Hard‑coding values without declaring parameters. → Declare parameters with ranges; bind at Work creation.
* **Undeclared variant drift.** Copy‑pasting specs and tweaking silently. → Use **VariantOf** with stated deltas or declare a refinement.
