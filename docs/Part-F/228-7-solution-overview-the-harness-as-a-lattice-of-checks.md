## 7 · Solution overview — the harness as a lattice of checks

The harness arranges checks in three clusters:

* **S‑Local.** context‑local sanity (anchoring, clustering, two‑register labels).
* **S-Cross.** Cross-artefact coherence (row reuse, single-cell **Role Description**, bridge discipline, window honesty).
* **R‑Evo.** Evolution continuity (no silent rewrites, no vocabulary creep, bridge re‑validation).

This Part 1 enumerates **SCR** (S‑Local and S‑Cross). Part 2 covers **RSCR**, anti‑patterns, worked “dry runs”, and acceptance summaries.
