## 16 · Didactic distillation (60‑second script)

> **Names are lenses.** The *thing* that persists is the **sense** (a SenseCell in a Context, a Concept‑Set row, a Role Description). When you improve a lens, use **`renames`** or **`aliases`** **inside that same place**. When the *thing* changes, say so with **`splits/merges`**—and adjust rows/Bridges accordingly. **Never rename across Contexts.** Keep at most **one** legacy alias per register. Do **not** rewrite history; give readers **read‑paths** and brief epoch notes. With this discipline, you can clarify language without erasing meaning, and your models keep both **continuity** and **truth**.
