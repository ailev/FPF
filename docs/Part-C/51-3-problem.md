## 3 · Problem

1. **Scope–Type conflation.** Teams broaden G by “abstracting” prose, not by adding supported slices.
2. **Unsafe composition.** Claims are joined though they talk about different “things.”
3. **Cross‑context drift.** Without an explicit core notion of kind, bridges blur describedEntity vs applicability.
