| **Uniformity vs locality** | Desire for consistent names vs Context‑specific idioms that must be preserved.      |
| **Parsimony vs recall**    | Keep the harvested set small vs keep rare but pivotal terms that unlock bridges. |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**  | Two‑register labels (tech/plain) vs fidelity to the canon’s own phraseology.     |
| **Speed vs safety**        | Move fast to enable F.3/F.4 vs avoid any Cross‑context conclusion in F.2.           |
