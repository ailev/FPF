| **Auditable reality.** Costs, time, and quality attach to concrete runs; root‑cause analysis and accountability improve. | **More records.** You create Work instances; mitigate with templates and automation.       |
| **Sound roll‑ups.** Γ\_time/Γ\_work turn roll‑ups from hand‑waving into declared policy; KPIs become comparable.         | **Policy discipline.** You must choose union vs hull and an overlap policy; write it once. |
| **Cross‑context clarity.** CAC checks prevent silent model drift; bridges make acceptance explicit.                      | **Bridge upkeep.** Keep mappings short and focused; review at releases.                    |
| **4D extensional coherence.** Parts/overlaps/retries stop double‑counting and identity confusion.                        | **Learning curve.** Teach episode vs retry; include examples in onboarding.                |
