| **Clarity across paradigms.** Methods are first‑class regardless of notation; teams stop arguing step‑vs‑functional.        | **One more name to learn.** Use the quick grammar card; it pays off fast.                          |
| **Reuse without personnel lock‑in.** assignment moves to RoleAssigning; Methods remain portable.                             | **Extra role tables.** Keep role‑kind lists short and context‑local.                               |
| **Robust audits.** Logs are Work, specs are MethodDescription, Standards are Method; no more “we thought the diagram was the run.” | **Discipline needed.** Enforce the three‑way split in reviews.                                     |
| **Constructor‑theoretic coherence.** Physical and informational transformations are peers.                                  | **Cultural shift.** Not every team is used to seeing SOPs and code as the same class (MethodDescription). |
