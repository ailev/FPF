# C.3.1 · **U.Kind & SubkindOf (Core)**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **`U.Kind`** as a **minimal, context‑local intensional carrier** for “what a claim is about,” and **`U.SubkindOf (⊑)`** as a **partial order** over kinds. **Kinds do not carry Scope.** Scope remains on **claims/capabilities** (USM). This core pattern supplies only identity, locality, and ordering; **intent & membership** (`KindSignature`, `Extension/MemberOf`) are specified in **C.3.2**, bridges & congruence in **C.3.3**, masks in **C.3.4**, and the AT facet in **C.3.5**.
