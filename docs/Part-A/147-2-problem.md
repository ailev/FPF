## 2 · Problem (what breaks without a clean notion of Work)

1. **Plan/run confusion.** Schedules and diagrams get mistaken for “the process,” so audits and KPIs become fiction.
2. **Spec/run conflation.** A method description (code/SOP) is reported as if it were an execution; conversely, logs are treated as recipes.
3. **Who/when leakage.** People and calendars are baked into specs; reuse and staffing agility collapse.
4. **Resource dishonesty.** Energy/money/tool wear are booked to methods or roles, not to actual runs; costing and sustainability metrics drift.
5. **Mereology muddle.** Teams hand‑wave over “sub‑runs,” retries, overlaps, or long‑running episodes; roll‑ups double‑count or miss work.
