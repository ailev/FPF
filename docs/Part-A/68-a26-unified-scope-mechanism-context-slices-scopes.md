# A.2.6 · **Unified Scope Mechanism (USM): Context Slices & Scopes**  \[A] 

> **One-line summary.** Introduces a single, context-local **scope mechanism** for all holons: **`U.ContextSlice`** (where we reason and measure) and a family of **set-valued scope types** (**USM scope objects, `U.Scope`**), specialized as **`U.ClaimScope`** for epistemes (**G** in **F–G–R**), **`U.WorkScope`** for system capabilities, and **`U.PublicationScope`** for publication carriers; with one algebra (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit) and uniform Cross-context handling (Bridge + CL).
