| #         | Anti‑pattern               | Symptom in the page                                            | Why it breaks thinking                                         | Remedy (point to this template & sibling patterns)                        |
| --------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP‑1**  | **Row‑less tour**          | A list of facts from many Contexts with no **Concept‑Set row**.   | Reader cannot see *what is treated as the same* for the claim. | Include **≥ 1 row ρ** spanning ≥ 2 Contexts (§5‑5, §6‑2).                    |
| **AP‑2**  | **Stealth bridging**       | Phrases like “basically the same” with no Bridge.              | Imports meaning Cross‑context; hides losses.                      | State a **Bridge β** with **kind, CL, loss** (§5‑6, F.9).                 |
| **AP-3**  | **Role-Description vagueness**          | A Role/Status named without a SenseCell.                       | Why it breaks thinking                                         | Remedy (point to this template & sibling patterns)                        |
| **AP‑4**  | **Global words**           | *process, role, service* appear unprefixed.                    | Context‑less words drift mid‑example.                             | Prefix first mention with the **Context** (*process (BPMN)*) (§6‑1, E.10.D1). |
| **AP‑5**  | **Window‑free comparison** | Numbers/targets compared with no stated window.                | Apples‑to‑oranges across time/scale.                           | Declare a **Window** for the Status (§5‑8, F.10).                         |
| **AP‑6**  | **SoD leakage**            | Duties named but the same actor implicitly holds both.         | Violates Separation‑of‑Duties intent.                          | State **SoD** and keep duties disjoint (§5‑8, F.14).                      |
| **AP‑7**  | **Design/run blur**        | A design‑time notion used as if it were a run‑time occurrence. | Category error; wrong Context claims.                             | Mark Context stance and keep claims in‑stance (§5‑3, §6‑5).                  |
| **AP‑8**  | **Edition haze**           | “BPMN”, “ITIL” without edition/profile.                        | Debates about “what the book says”.                            | Put **name + edition** on each Card (§5‑3).                               |
| **AP‑9**  | **CL silence**             | Bridge kind given, no CL or loss note.                         | Reader cannot gauge translation risk.                          | Add **CL** and **loss** in every Bridge (§5‑6, B.3).                      |
| **AP‑10** | **Over‑row**               | Ten cells glued into one row “for convenience”.                | Collapses distinct senses; unreadable.                         | Prefer **one tight row**; split into **two rows** if needed (§5‑5, §8).   |
