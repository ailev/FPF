## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — shorthand for `U.BoundedContext` (per E.10.D1).
* **senseFamily** — **referenced from F.0.1**; not redefined here; used to **type** rows and to require **uniformity** within a row.
* **SenseCell** — a **(Context × Local‑Sense)** address from F.3.
* **Bridge (F.9)** — an explicit, declarative Cross‑context mapping with a **congruence level** **CL** and **loss note**.
* **Characteristic (MM‑CHR)** — measurable comparandum defined in **MM‑CHR**; may be referenced in **Measurement/KD‑metric** rows; **do not** use “axis” only as a euphemism.
* **Concept‑Set (row)** — a *licensed sameness* across Contexts, bounded by **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**.
* **Contrast row** — a *non‑sameness* row: same surface across Contexts with **no** sufficient Bridges; teaches **difference**, not unity.
