| Force                           | Tension to resolve                                                                                     |

| **Expressiveness vs parsimony** | We must name real distinctions, but each new name increases cognitive load.                            |
| **Locality vs uniformity**      | Roles/Statuses are **context‑local**; yet we need a stable Cross‑context story through Concept‑Set rows.     |
| **Safety vs convenience**       | SoD constraints protect systems, but people seek convenience through composite roles.                  |
| **Temporal honesty**            | Many “new” Statuses are actually the **same** Status seen in different **windows** (design/run/grace). |
