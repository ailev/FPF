## 11 · Local‑Sense Cards (one‑glance form)

> A **Local‑Sense Card** is a **one‑glance** sketch per sense in a Context. It teaches faster than prose lists and keeps senses crisp.

**Fields (thought‑items, not fields to fill):**

* **Context** (U.BoundedContext, edition)
* **Label pair** — **Tech** (idiomatic) · **Plain** (didactic)
* **Sense line** — one sentence in the Context’s voice
* **Inside** — which F.2 Units it consolidates (names only)
* **Counter‑example** — a short use that must **not** be included
