## 17 · Didactic close (60‑second recap)

> **Within one context,** collect how the canon actually **uses** a head, not how we wish it did. **Merge** aliases that never lead to different conclusions; **split** uses that do. Give each consolidated use a crisp **Tech** label in the Context’s idiom and a faithful **Plain** label. The pair *(Context, Local-Sense)* is your **SenseCell**—the address later cited by Role Descriptions, tables, and bridges. No Cross‑context mergers here; that job belongs to F.9. Keep senses few, boundaries sharp, and labels honest.
