## 7 · Outputs (conceptual, not clerical)

F.3 yields, **per Context**:

1. A **small set of Local‑Senses**, each with:

   * **Label pair**: *Tech* (idiomatic) · *Plain* (didactic).
   * **Sense line**: one‑sentence usage statement, in the Context’s voice.
   * **Inside list** (informative): which Units from F.2 it consolidates.
   * **Counter‑example** (optional but powerful): a short use that must **not** be included.
1. A **SenseCell address** for each Local‑Sense: *(Context, Local‑Sense)*.

These are **thinking reference points** (cognitive only), not records or files. Later patterns **cite SenseCells by name**; nothing about storage is implied.
