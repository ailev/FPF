## 6 · Didactic Metaphor (informative)

* **Contexts.** Each `U.BoundedContext` is a **Context**; its **Context Card** is a sign on the door (name, edition, time stance, trip‑wires).
* **Words in a Context.** A **SenseCell** is a dictionary entry pinned to that Context’s wall.
* **Door‑to‑door links.** An **Alignment Bridge** is a labelled passage connecting two Contexts; a **CL** placard says how trustworthy that passage is.

> *We first speak inside Contexts; only then decide which doors to connect—and with what warnings.*
