## 2 · Problem frame

When Method, MethodDescription, Work, and Actuation **collapse into one another**, models drift:

1. **Design/run blur.** A BPMN *process* (design graph) is cited as if it had *happened*.
2. **Recipe/approval fallacy.** An *approved* SOP (MethodDescription) is treated as proof that the service met its SLO.
3. **Execution ≟ control.** PLC *task execution* logs are conflated with *control outputs* (actuation), hiding stability issues.
4. **Cross‑context homonymy.** *Activity, task, execution, process, command* change sense across Contexts; inferences quietly break.
