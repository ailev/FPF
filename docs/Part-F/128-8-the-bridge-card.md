## 8 · The Bridge Card (one‑screen sketch)

> A **thought‑format** (not a form). Every bullet can be said in a sentence.

* **Cells.** `σA@contextA` ↔ `σB@contextB`.
* **senseFamily.** *Role / Status / Measurement / Type‑structure / Method / Execution …*
* **Kind.** *≈ / ⊑ / ⊒ / ⋂ / ⊥ / ⇄ᴅʀ / →ᴍᴇᵃ / →ᴅᵉᵒ*.
* **Direction.** *A→B* (if non‑symmetric) or *A↔B*.
* **CL.** *0–3* with a short **why**.
* **Loss Notes (bullets).** What fails to carry (units, scope, granularity, preconditions, time stance).
* **Counter‑example.** The crispest case where substitution would mislead.
* **Allowed use.** *Naming-only / Role Assignment & Enactment-eligible / Type-structure / Explanation-only*.
* **Didactic hook.** The helpful sentence a careful engineer can remember.

*If your Bridge Card doesn’t fit on a screen, you’re describing the Contexts, not the Bridge.*
