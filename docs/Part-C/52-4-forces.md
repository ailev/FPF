| **Minimality vs utility**      | Keep the core tiny yet sufficient for composition and governance.         |
| **Locality vs reuse**          | Kinds are context‑local, but projects reuse claims across Contexts via bridges. |
| **describedEntity vs applicability** | Ordering should not leak into Scope; kinds must not carry G.              |
| **Neutrality vs specificity**  | Avoid committing to any particular type/ontology stack or notation.       |
