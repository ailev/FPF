| Force                          | Tension to resolve                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Locality vs comparison**     | Meaning lives in Contexts; yet we must **compare** Contexts to reason across disciplines.                           |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**      | A compact row is easy to grasp; it must still show **scope and loss** honestly.                               |
| **Simplicity vs completeness** | A minimal grid aids memory; temptation to overload it with proofs and procedures must be resisted.            |
| **Sameness vs difference**     | Some families **cannot** be unified; the table must support **contrast rows** without pretending equivalence. |
