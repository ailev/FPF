## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Old “anchor” language.** Replace legacy “anchor” with: **SenseCell** (local sense) + **Role Description** (assignable Standard) + (optionally) **Concept‑Set row** (Cross‑context reading).
2. **Over-strong rows.** If a row was used for **assignment/enactment-eligibility** or **Type-structure** but **CL drops**, **downgrade row scope** to **Naming-only** in prose; adjust examples.
3. **Split rows.** If one row covers cells whose Bridges diverge, **split** into two narrower rows with explicit loss notes.
4. **Alias proliferation.** Collapse redundant Aliases under a single F.5 entry; keep both registers (Tech/Plain).
5. **Proto‑types.** Suspect kernel inflation? Attempt **reduction**: SenseCell + row + existing U.Type. Only if irreducible across ≥ 3 families, reopen as a U.Type candidate.
