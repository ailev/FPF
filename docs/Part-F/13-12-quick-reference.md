* **Context** = a `U.BoundedContext` with edition, scope, and (if inherent) time stance.
* **SenseCell** = the minimal, lexical unit of meaning inside a Context (Tech/Plain labels + gloss).
* **Bridge** = the only Cross‑context relation, labelled with `relation` and **CL**, plus a short loss/fit note.
* **Concept‑Set row** = a didactic table row collecting **SenseCells** that are sufficiently the‑same‑thing under declared Bridges.

> **Mental checklist:** *Name the Context → speak in the Context → connect Contexts only by labelled bridges → build rows from bridged cells.*
