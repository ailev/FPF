## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — short for `U.BoundedContext` (per D.CTX).
* **Unit** — a context‑local lexical unit from F.2 (LNF + Tech/Plain + gloss).
* **Local‑Sense** — the **conceptual cluster** of Units deemed “same sense” **within that Context**.
* **SenseCell** — the **address** for a Local‑Sense: *(Context, Local‑Sense)*. This is what later patterns will **cite**.
* **Counter‑example** — a short, canonical sentence or use that **must not** be covered by the Local‑Sense; it sharpens the boundary.
* **Usage cue** *(informative)* — a clue from usage (collocational patterns, paraphrases, entailments in the canon) that **suggests** merge or split. Cues **do not decide**; the canon’s intent does.
