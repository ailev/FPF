## 1 · Intent & Applicability

**Intent.** Eliminate ambiguity around “context” by (a) fixing **one** formal meaning—`U.BoundedContext`; (b) removing “anchor” from the vocabulary; (c) reserving **Problem Frame** for prose about situations; and (d) clarifying **Domain** as an **informative family** (workflow, provenance, services, …) that groups several `U.BoundedContext`s.

**Applicability.** Mandatory across **all architheories** (Role Assignment & Enactment, Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, planned LCA-CAL). Apply at the start of any unification effort and whenever documentation introduces or refactors “context”, “domain”, “anchor”.

**Non‑goals.** No governance, workflow, or tool mandates; no storage formats; no team roles.
