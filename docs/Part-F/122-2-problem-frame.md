## 2 · Problem frame

Cross‑context work fails in predictable ways:

1. **String‑equals fallacy.** Identical surfaces (“process”, “role”, “accuracy”) taken as identical meaning.
2. **Scope creep.** A naming convenience is stretched to assignment or structural claims.
3. **DesignRunTag jumping.** Design artefacts are substituted for run‑time occurrences (or vice‑versa).
4. **Direction amnesia.** Narrower/broader relations treated as symmetric.
5. **Loss blindness.** Differences (units, granularity, preconditions) are left unstated, contaminating downstream reasoning.

Bridges cure these by **making relation, direction, loss, and strength explicit**.
