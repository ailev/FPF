## 1 · Problem context

**Intent.** Provide one **normative** rule‑set that makes FPF language **unambiguous, composable across contexts, and teachable** by design. Authors, reviewers, and tooling can point to **LEX‑BUNDLE** as the single source of truth for:

* **Vertical stratification** (Kernel ↔ Architheory ↔ Context ↔ Instance);
* **Twin registers** (Tech/Plain) with safe synonyms;
* **Naming morphology** (allowed suffixes & style) for the kernel’s core objects;
* **Minimal Generality** tests (names are neither parochial nor vacuous);
* **Canonical rewrites** for overloaded words (e.g., *process*, *function*, *service*);
* **Conformance checks** (lintable) and minimal examples.

**Scope.** Applies to:
(a) **Core** (Parts A–G), (b) **Architheory specs** (CAL/LOG/CHR), (c) **Context glossaries** that claim FPF conformity, and (d) **Diagrams/prose** in normative text. It **does not** constrain Tooling or Pedagogy wording other than where they quote Core semantics.
