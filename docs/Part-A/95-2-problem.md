## 2 · Problem (what goes wrong without a clean notion of “method”)

1. **Process soup.** “Process” gets used for recipe, execution, schedule, or org area. Planning, staffing, and audit blur together.
2. **Spec = run fallacy.** A flowchart (or code) is taken as if execution already happened; conversely, logs get mistaken for the recipe.
3. **Role leakage.** People encode assignments inside the recipe (“this step is the surgeon”), tying **who** to **how** and making reuse impossible.
4. **Notation lock‑in.** When “method” is defined as “a set of steps,” functional or logical styles become second‑class citizens and cannot be modeled cleanly.
