## 2 · Problem frame

Modellers tend to **mint names** when they actually need **reuse**, **aliasing**, or **explicit Cross‑context reading**. Consequences:

1. **Name inflation.** Parallel labels for the same idea across Contexts.
2. **senseFamily mixing.** Behavioural **Role** names that smuggle in deontic **Status** or measurement talk.
3. **Hidden bridges.** Cross‑context sameness is implied by look‑alike words rather than declared (F.9).
4. **Kernel sprawl.** New **U.Types** appear to plaster over local vocabulary gaps.
