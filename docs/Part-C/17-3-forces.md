| Force                                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                                                             |

| **Human ↔ Formal system**                         | Natural language is fast and legible; formal systems are unambiguous and checkable. We need a spectrum, not a cliff.                           |
| **Local freedom ↔ Global comparability**          | Contexts must be free to set thresholds; cross‑context reasoning requires a shared scale and anchors.                                          |
| **Readability ↔ Precision**                       | Rich narrative aids understanding; tight syntax prevents misinterpretation. The characteristic must not force one at the expense of the other. |
| **Open‑world thinking ↔ Closed‑world guarantees** | Exploration benefits from openness; certification needs explicit closure. F must support gradual “closing” without renaming the artifact.      |
