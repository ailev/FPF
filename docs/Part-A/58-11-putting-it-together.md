## 11 · Putting it together (one‑screen mental model)

At any **Window**:

1. **RoleAssignment exists** (A.2.1): `Holder#Role:Context`.
2. **StateAssertion(s) exist**: the holder is **in** one or more **states** as proven by checklists (`U.Evaluation`).
3. **Green‑Gate Law** applies: if at least one asserted state is **enactable**, role‑gated **Method steps** may be enacted; if all are **status‑only**, the role can **gate decisions** but **not** perform work.
4. **Role algebra** checks: specialization lifts readiness; bundles require **conjunction**; incompatibilities are detected when **two enactable states** coincide for the same holder at the same Window.

This yields a **clean separation**:

* **assignment** (RoleAssignment)
* **Readiness** (RSG + Checklists + StateAssertions)
* **Action** (`U.Work`, gated by RSG)

…and keeps meaning **local**, evidence **observable**, and reasoning **testable**.
