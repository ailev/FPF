## 16 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 16.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F3‑S01 (context‑locality).** Every Local‑Sense is paired with **exactly one context**; no Cross‑context clustering appears.
* **SCR‑F3‑S02 (Label pair).** Each Local‑Sense has **Tech** (idiomatic) and **Plain** (didactic) labels; neither widens usage beyond the sense line.
* **SCR‑F3‑S03 (Sense line fidelity).** Each sense line is **grounded in canonical statements** of the Context; no behaviour/deontic/math content.
* **SCR‑F3‑S04 (Parsimony).** The set of Local‑Senses per Context is small enough to **recall unaided** by a careful mind.
* **SCR‑F3‑S05 (Counter‑example presence).** For any ambiguous head, at least one **counter‑example** is recorded to guard the boundary.
* **SCR‑F3‑S06 (Temporal honesty).** Where the Context has a declared stance, sense lines **respect design/run**.

### 16.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F3‑E01 (Merge soundness).** Every merge is justified by a **failed distinction test** (no selectional or entailment difference).
* **RSCR‑F3‑E02 (Split necessity).** Every split cites a **role/entailment conflict** or a concrete **counter‑example**.
* **RSCR‑F3‑E03 (Edition guard).** No Local‑Sense spans Contexts that differ by edition **with usage shift**.
* **RSCR‑F3‑E04 (Label stability).** Changes to labels do **not** change sense; if they do, the change is treated as a split/merge per E01/E02.
* **RSCR‑F3‑E05 (Downstream continuity).** After splits/merges, **SenseCell** references in F.4/F.7/F.9 remain **referentially clear** (new addresses are explicit; no silent aliasing).
