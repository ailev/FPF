## 6 · Solution — how to think the clustering (notation‑free)

> What follows are **mental moves**, not steps for a team. Use them as probes until the Context’s usage partitions itself naturally.

**6.1 Consolidate aliases into one Local‑Sense.**
If Units differ only by **orthography, abbreviation, or canon‑blessed synonymy** and are **used interchangeably** in the Context’s own sentences, treat them as **one Local‑Sense**.
*Example (ITIL):* *service‑level‑objective* and *SLO* → one Local‑Sense.

**6.2 Split on incompatible selectional frames.**
If the same head pairs with **different kinds of arguments** or plays **different roles** in the canon’s statements (and those roles cannot both be true at once), split.
*Example (BPMN):* *event* as **node type** vs as **occurrence narrative** in a tutorial → two Local‑Senses; adopt the **node type** sense if that is the normative layer.

**6.3 Split on entailments that pull apart.**
If paraphrases lead to **different entailments** (e.g., one implies temporality, another structural position), you have two senses.
*Example (PROV):* *activity* implies **time‑bounded use/generate**; it cannot be the same sense as a **static capability**.

**6.4 Prefer sense minimality.**
If two candidate Local‑Senses never lead to **different conclusions** in the Context’s own use, merge them. If they sometimes do, split them—and record a **counter‑example** to keep the boundary crisp.

**6.5 Keep Tech label idiomatic; Plain label helpful.**
Tech label stays as the canon speaks; Plain label conveys the **function** of the sense to a careful newcomer. Neither label may **broaden** the sense beyond usage.

**6.6 Name only as much as you will use.**
If a fine-grained split has **no downstream consequence** (Role Descriptions, tables, bridges), prefer the coarser Local-Sense.
