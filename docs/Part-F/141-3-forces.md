| Force                                     | Tension to resolve                                                                             |

| **Local fidelity vs Cross‑context reuse**    | Keep native Context meanings, yet enable explanation and (sometimes) substitution.                |
| **Didactic simplicity vs status variety** | Many status schemes exist; we need a **small spine** that admits Context synonyms.                |
| **Design vs run**                         | Standards speak design; evidence speaks run; requirements span both; do not swap them.         |
| **Safety vs utility**                     | Substitution is powerful but risky; explanation is safer but weaker. Make the choice explicit. |
