## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **minimal, notation‑free harness of conceptual checks** that tells you whether a unification slice is **sound**: Contexts are fixed and diverse (F.1), terms are harvested and clustered **inside** Contexts (F.2–F.3), Role Descriptions **point to one SenseCell** (F.4), names obey discipline (F.5), rows are reused instead of multiplied (F.7–F.8), bridges are **explicit and penalised** (F.9), statuses vary by **windows** not type proliferation (F.10), and cross‑line bindings (F.11–F.12) respect locality.
**Applicability.** Use whenever you declare or revise any of: Context cards, Local‑Senses, SenseCells, Concept‑Set rows, Role Descriptions, Bridges, Status windows.
**Non‑goals.** No registries, workflows, or storage formats. No team roles. No metrics dashboards. This is **thinking discipline**, not governance.
