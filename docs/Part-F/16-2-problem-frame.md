## 2 · Problem frame

Without explicit context of meaning:

1. **Word‑drift.** Common words (*process*, *role*, *service*, *model*) silently change sense across disciplines.
2. **Scope mirages.** One influential standard is mistaken for *the* domain.
3. **Retro‑lock.** Old editions become the implicit truth simply because they were “there first”.
4. **Category bleed.** Behavioural roles, epistemic statuses, deontic permissions mix because their contexts were never fixed.
5. **Name inflation.** New U.Types appear just to “stabilise” unstable words.
