## 10 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #         | Anti‑pattern                | Symptom in a row                                                               | Why it breaks thinking                                               | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                          |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP‑1**  | **Bridge‑free sameness**    | Cells listed as “same” because their labels look alike; no cited Bridges.      | Violates locality; imports meaning across Contexts by name.             | A row **exists only** if backed by **F.9 Bridges**. Otherwise produce a **contrast row**.                         |
| **AP-2**  | **Scope creep**             | Row labelled “Type-structure” but used to justify **assignment/enactment-eligibility** or KD metrics. | Scope licences are not transferable; inference leaks.                | Keep a **small controlled set of Row Scopes**. If use widens, **mint a new row** or **re-bridge** with higher CL. |
| **AP‑3**  | **senseFamily mixing**      | One row mixes Role, Status, Measurement, and Type‑structure cells.             | Conflates senseFamily (F.0.1); readers cannot tell “what kind of sameness”. | **Type each row.** If two senseFamilys are needed, **split** into two rows.                                             |
| **AP‑4**  | **Temporal blur**           | Cells with incompatible DesignRunTag declared “same”.                     | Design artefacts ≠ run occurrences; claims invert.                   | Either **harmonise stance** (choose only compatible cells) or publish a **contrast row**.                         |
| **AP‑5**  | **Loss denial**             | Bridges carry loss notes, but the row omits counter‑examples.                  | Readers over‑trust; misuse outside safe scope.                       | Add a **one‑line counter‑example** that illustrates the loss.                                                     |
| **AP‑6**  | **CL averaging**            | Row CL(min) computed as an average of heterogeneous Bridges.                   | The weakest link governs; averages overstate safety.                 | Row CL(min) is the **bottleneck** (minimum along connecting paths).                                               |
| **AP‑7**  | **Overwide rows**           | 6–8 Contexts in one row; hard to read; subtle mismatches hide.                    | Violates didactic primacy; invites hidden losses.                    | **Parsimony**: 2–4 Contexts per row unless each extra cell has a **distinct necessity** you can state in one line.   |
| **AP‑8**  | **Minted paraphrases**      | Cells reword a Context’s label instead of citing the SenseCell.                   | Hides locality; future drift becomes invisible.                      | **Cells are Context‑loyal.** Use the Context’s own SenseCell label.                                                     |
| **AP‑9**  | **Duplicate rows by style** | Two rows with the same cell set but different FPF labels.                      | Name inflation; readers assume two distinct concepts.                | Keep **one row** per Concept‑Set per scope. Alternative labels appear as **aliases** in F.5, not new rows.        |
| **AP‑10** | **Implied transitivity**    | A↔B and B↔C Bridges exist; row silently assumes A↔C at the same CL.            | Paths can reduce CL; semantics might not compose.                    | Compute CL for **A↔C via bottleneck**; if too low, either reduce **Row Scope** or **omit** the cell.              |
