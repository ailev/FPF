## 8 · Invariants (normative, lightweight)

1. **Context‑first.** Every decision cites at least one **Context**; no global senses.
2. **senseFamily purity.** A single decision covers **one senseFamily**. Mixed needs are split.
3. **Row honesty.** Any Cross‑context reuse occurs **via a Concept‑Set row** at or above **τ(scope)**; no stealth equivalence.
4. **Role Description anchoring.** Role Descriptions are **single-Context**, **single-cell** anchors (F.4).
5. **Alias modesty.** Aliases **never** change semantics and live under F.5.
6. **Kernel restraint.** New **U.Types** are **rare**; A.8 **(≥ 3 families)** is mandatory, and duplication with existing U.Types must be ruled out.
