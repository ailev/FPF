## 2 · Problem frame (recurring confusions this removes)

1. **Type explosion.** Baking transient function into rigid types (“CoolingPump”, “AuditDeveloper”) violates parsimony and makes change brittle.
2. **Context drift.** Labels like *Operator*, *Process Owner*, *Standard* slide in meaning across teams/years when not tied to a **Context**.
3. **Actor vagueness.** Work logs state that things happened but not **who, in what capacity**, under which **local rules**.
4. **Category leaks.** Documents “do” tasks; deontic statuses are treated like run‑time states; capabilities are confused with permissions.
5. **Role chains.** Attempting “System ↦ TransformerRole ↦ AgentRole” mixes **independent** role families and hides design intent.
