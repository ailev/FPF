## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Clause revisions.** Introduce a **new ClauseCell**; keep old verdicts intact (Non‑retroactivity).
2. **Monitor changes.** Update or replace **Bridges** (kind/CL/Loss). Future verdicts use the new Bridge; past ones are annotated, not rewritten.
3. **Scope corrections.** If evidence was about the wrong **Work**, retire the verdict and restate the quadruple; do **not** patch by redefining the Clause.
4. **Unit harmonisation.** When scales/units change, apply **KD‑CAL** conversions inside the Measure’s Context; if Cross‑context mapping is needed, declare a **Bridge**.
5. **Population refinement.** If a Clause’s quantifier is refined (e.g., per‑region → per‑AZ), treat each as a new ClauseCell or a new Window partition; avoid hidden re‑baselining.
6. **Proxy retirement.** When direct Observations become available, prefer them; keep earlier proxy‑based verdicts with their CL/Loss notes.
