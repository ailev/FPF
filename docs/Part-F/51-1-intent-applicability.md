## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Consolidate the **context‑local lexical units** from F.2 into a **small set of Local‑Senses** that actually operate in that **one context (U.BoundedContext)**. Each Local‑Sense receives a crisp, didactic label pair (Tech/Plain) and a short sense statement. The result is an **addressable basis** for later uses (Role Assignment, tables, bridges) that is **still strictly context‑local**.

**Applicability.** Apply **after** F.2 for any Context that will feed naming (F.4/F.5), decision gates (F.8), Cross‑context bridges (F.9), or exemplars in Part C. Use again whenever the canon (edition) **shifts usage** enough to split or merge senses **within the same context**.

**Non‑goals.** No Cross‑context comparison or merging. No behaviour/deontics/type mathematics. No storage schemas or workflows. This is **pure sense‑making** inside one context.
