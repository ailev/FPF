## 7 · Evidence Semantics (Normative)

### 7.1  What an Evidence Stub is (and is not)

**Definition.** `U.EvidenceStub` is a **conceptual pointer** that ties a **measure** to the **grounds** sufficient for independent checking (observations, arguments, lawful transformations). It is not the run log, not the carrier, and not the intensional characteristic itself. This keeps **intension–description–specification** distinct per E.10.D2 and the Clarity Lattice.

**Rule Σ‑1.** Whether evidence is **required** is a **property of the metric template**; if required, each `U.Measure` **SHALL** include an `U.EvidenceStub`.
**Rule Σ‑2.** Evidence composition is **commutative, associative, idempotent** at the concept level (sets/multisets of grounds); combining grounds can never *reduce* what is knowable about the measure’s warrant.
**Rule Σ‑3.** *Soundness minimum:* there exists a conceptual chain linking **bearer → Characteristic → Scale/Unit → admissible method/episteme**. (No “free‑floating numbers”.)
**Rule Σ‑4.** Declared *agreement* constructs (e.g., dual readings, panels) **MUST** be appropriate to the scale type (rank concordance for ordinal; tolerances for interval/ratio).
*Anchors:* MM‑CHR units/evidence notion; Strict Distinction and the separation of objects from their descriptions/specs.
