> **Name less, express more.** Before minting a new Role or Status, try **four levers**:
> **(1) Reuse the row** — if the intent already exists, adopt it and add your local SenseCell.
> **(2) Bundle, don’t blur** — when two Roles travel together, **Bundle** them; keep **SoD** if they must stay apart.
> **(3) Declare SoD, don’t fuse** — conflicts of interest are solved with **SoD**, not with “trusted” super‑roles.
> **(4) Window, don’t multiply** — one **Status** can wear different **windows** (evaluation/active/grace); that’s not four Status types.
> Keep modifiers as **facets**, not names; keep every Role Description **context‑local** via its SenseCell. If your vocabulary no longer fits in a thoughtful mind, you have an **explosion**—return to the levers and reduce.
