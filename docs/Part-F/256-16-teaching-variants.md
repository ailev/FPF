## 16 · Teaching variants (all obey §6 invariants)

* **Two‑Context equivalence.** Smallest case: 1 row, 2 Contexts, **β (≡, CL=3)** to explain why they’re truly the same *for this claim*.
* **Triangulation.** 1 row, 3 Contexts; typical for *measurement ↔ service ↔ execution*.
* **Disjointness lesson.** No row; one **β (disjoint)** plus a short SoD story.
* **Window primer.** Same sense across Contexts but different default windows; the page is about the **window choice**, not the term.
