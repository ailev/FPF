## 2 · Context

across Contexts, “type” means OWL class, SHACL shape, code type, BORO category, etc. A **neutral, minimal** object is needed to name *the kind of entities* a claim quantifies over **without** importing a full type system or altering USM. **`U.Kind`** fills that role; **ordering** between kinds captures “is‑a/refines” relationships a Context relies on.
