## 14 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**
E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)** — ensures *Context* ≡ *U.BoundedContext* and reserves “Problem Frame” for narrative use.
A.7 **Strict Distinction** — guards object/description/carrier and design/run splits while you cut Contexts.
A.11 **Ontological Parsimony** — motivates the small cut.

**Constrains:**
**F.2** (Term Harvesting): harvest **inside** Contexts named here; every occurrence carries a Context name.
**F.3** (Intra‑Context Sense Clustering): cluster **per Context**; no Cross‑context sense claims.
**F.4** (Role Descriptions): any role/status template must cite a **SenseCell** that lives in a Context from this cut.
**F.9** (Alignment & Bridge): only F.9 may relate Contexts; never F.1–F.4.

**Used by.**
Architheories in Part C (Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Kind-CAL, Method‑CAL, LCA‑CAL) as the *lexical starting grid* for their examples and definitions.
