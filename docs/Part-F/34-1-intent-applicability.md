## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual** (notation‑free) discipline for turning *Context‑internal usage* into **context‑local lexical units** ready for later reasoning—without Cross‑context merging and without slipping into governance or tooling. The result is a **small, auditable set of context‑local names and glosses** that faithfully reflect how the canon speaks.

**Applicability.** Use whenever a unification line (from F.1) needs **actual words** to be referenced by patterns in Part C (architheories) or by Role Descriptions (F.4). Re‑enter F.2 when a canon/edition changes or when a new Context is admitted in F.1.

**Non‑goals.** No global labels; no Cross‑context equivalence; no workflow or role descriptions; no storage/API talk. F.2 specifies **how to think**, not how to “run a pipeline”.
