| Force                                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                                                                               |

| **One mechanism vs two worlds**                   | We must serve both **knowledge about the world** (claims) and **doing work in the world** (capabilities) **without** duplicating concepts.                       |
| **Locality vs interoperability**                  | Scope must be **context‑local** and precisely checkable, yet transferable across Contexts via Bridges **without redefining** the characteristic.                       |
| **Expressivity vs minimal vocabulary**            | Teams need to capture rich conditions (time windows, environment, versions) but not explode the lexicon into “envelope/applicability/…” variants.                |
| **Static content vs operational change**          | Claims may hold broadly while current operations are narrow (or vice versa). The mechanism must keep “what is true” and “what can be done” aligned yet distinct. |
| **Open‑world exploration vs closed‑world gating** | Exploration benefits from permissive drafts; **gates** require crisp, observable checks. The same scope object must support both.                                |
