## 1 · Problem Frame

After we have agreed **who is assigned** (via **Role assignment**), **what they can do** (via **Capability**), and **how in principle** it should be done (via **Method/MethodDescription**), we still need a precise concept for **what actually happened** in real time and space.

That concept is **`U.Work`**: the **dated run‑time occurrence** of enacting a MethodDescription by a specific performer under a Role assignment, with concrete parameter bindings, resource consumption, and outcomes, **anchored to a domain referent that actually changes** (asset/product/dataset) — **not** merely the manipulation of records about that referent. Managers care about Work because it is the **only place** where cost, time, defects, and evidence are **real**. Architects care because Work ties plans and specs to accountable execution.
