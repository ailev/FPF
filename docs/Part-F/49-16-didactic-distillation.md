> “In F.2 you **harvest inside Contexts**. For each Context, pick the canon’s own phrasing, choose a **Local Normal Form** in that idiom, add **Tech** and **Plain** labels, and write a one‑sentence **Gloss** that matches how that Context talks. Stop there. No bridging, no behaviour, no equations. If the same string appears in another Context, treat it as a **different unit**. These units feed F.3, where you’ll sort senses **within** a Context, and F.9, where you’ll relate Contexts explicitly. This keeps meaning local, names faithful, and later reasoning clean.”
