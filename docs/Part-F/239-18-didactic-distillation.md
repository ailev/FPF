> “Use the harness to **think like a safety net**. First, the **SCR** threads: everything is **local** to a Context; **Role Descriptions** point to **one** SenseCell; rows actually **cross** Contexts; Bridges are explicit with CL and a loss note; windows capture variation without spawning new types. Then, the **RSCR** knots: never overwrite an edition—**fork the Context** or mark recency; keep rows stable by **retiring and re-rowing**; Bridges get **re-validated** (CL goes down unless you bring proof); renames become **aliases** unless meaning changes; **windows** absorb time/scale shifts; **SoD** stays intact. If you can pass these thoughts on a small slice—and explain each pass in **one breath**—your unification is green. No tooling, no roles, no dashboards. Just clean Contexts, honest rows, cautious bridges, and names that help minds meet.”
