## 6 · Invariants (normative)

1. **Locality of meaning.** Every term in the narrative appears **with its Context** at first mention (*process (BPMN)*, *activity (PROV)*, …).
2. **At least one row.** The example **MUST** include ≥ 1 **Concept‑Set row** spanning ≥ 2 Contexts.
3. **Single-cell Role Description.** Every **Role Description** in the example **MUST** point to **one** SenseCell.
4. **Explicit bridges.** Any Cross‑context step **not explained by the row** **MUST** appear as a **Bridge** with kind, CL, and loss.
5. **Temporal honesty.** If a Context fixes **design vs run**, the narrative respects it.
6. **Window discipline.** If comparison depends on time/scale/phase, a **window** is stated rather than minting a new Status type.
7. **SoD integrity.** If duties are involved, **SoD** is explicit and unbroken.
8. **Didactic parsimony.** One page, one claim, one row (or a tiny bundle of closely related rows).
