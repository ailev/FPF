## 16 · Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> **Three families, two modalities.** *Evidence* tells us what the world **shows** (Observed→Measured→Corroborated→Replicated; Refuted cancels) — **epistemic**; *Standard* tells us what a canon **sanctions** (Candidate→Draft→Approved→Deprecated→Superseded) — **deontic**; *Requirement* tells us what an obligation is **doing** (Applicable/Inapplicable; Satisfied/Violated; Waived/Pending) — **deontic**.
> Every status is a **StatusCell inside one Context** with exactly one **StatusModality**, a **Target**, and a **Window**.
> When you must relate status meanings across Contexts, **draw a Bridge** that states the **kind** (≈, ⊑/⊒, ⋂, ⊥ or Interpretation), the **CL** (strength), and the **Loss** (what you ignore). Prefer **explanation**; allow **substitution** only when statusModalities match, kind permits, **CL≥θ**, and Windows align.
> Keep **design vs run** stance honest: approval is **design‑time**, evidence is **run‑time**, requirements **span both**. With this habit, “validated”, “approved” and “compliant” stop being a muddle of synonyms and become **precise, local meanings** you can compare **safely** and **audibly**.
