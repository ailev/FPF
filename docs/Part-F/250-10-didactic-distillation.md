> “A good cross‑domain example fits on **one page**. First, name the **claim**. Then show the **Contexts** you’re using. List the **SenseCells** you will actually touch. Draw **one row** that makes them the same **for this claim**. Every Cross‑context nuance you can’t justify in that row becomes a **Bridge** with a **kind**, a **CL**, and a **loss** sentence. Point each **Role Description** to **one** cell. If time/scale matters, state the **window**; if duties matter, state **SoD**. Finish with two or three **harness pings** from F.15. That’s it—no tooling, no long procedures. The reader can now replay your thought and agree (or disagree) at the right place.”
