## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Prevent the uncontrolled growth of **Roles** and **Statuses** by privileging **reuse**, **bundling**, **explicit separation‑of‑duties (SoD)**, and **applicability windows** over minting new names. Keep the vocabulary **small, crisp, and composable** while remaining faithful to local meanings fixed by Contexts (F.1) and SenseCells (F.3).

**Applicability.** Whenever a new Role/Status is proposed, a team merges two lines of work, or a domain shifts its jargon. Use this pattern before adding rows to the Concept‑Set Table (F.7) or new Role Descriptions (F.4).

**Non‑goals.** No org charts, no RBAC policies, no process roles. This pattern describes **mental moves** for architectural naming, not governance machinery.
