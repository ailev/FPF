## 3 · Problem

1. **Ambiguous membership.** Membership depends on tacit “latest” states or unwritten defaults.
2. **Signature opacity.** A kind’s definition is scattered; no single place to declare rigor (**F**) or assumptions.
3. **Order violations.** Subkind hierarchies do not guarantee subset behavior in practice.
4. **Scope leakage.** Teams smuggle applicability (G) into kind definitions, recreating G‑ladders by another name.
