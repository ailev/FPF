## A.4  Temporal Duality & Open‑Ended Evolution Principle \[A] 

*“A holon is born in design‑time, lives in run‑time,  
and is reborn when the world talks back.”*

### Problem frame  
A holon’s **blueprint** and its **lived reality** are never identical for
long.  Pumps wear out, theories meet anomalous data, workflows face
unanticipated load.  FPF therefore requires a temporal framework that:

1. Physically grounds every modification (via the Transformer Principle,
   A 3).  
2. Supports unbounded improvement cycles (**P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution**).  
3. Works identically for physical, epistemic, operational (method, work) and future
   holon flavours.

### Problem  

| Failure mode | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Blueprint ≡ Reality** | “As‑built” discrepancies remain invisible; safety and validity claims become fiction. |
| **Implicit magic updates** | Versions overwrite each other; provenance chains snap. |
| **Observer special‑case** | Measurement treated as metaphysical rather than a normal, physically grounded transformation. |

### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Stability vs Change** | Identify a holon across time ↔ allow radical redesigns. |
| **Prediction vs Evidence** | Plan with intended specs ↔ respond to real telemetry. |
| **Parsimony vs Expressiveness** | Keep the model lean ↔ respect the full lifecycle complexity. |

---

### Solution · Temporal Duality Model  

FPF assigns every holon state to one—and only one—of two **temporal
scopes**:

| Scope | Symbol | Definition | Typical contents |
|-------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Design‑Time** | *Tᴰ* | Interval(s) during which the holon **may be structurally altered** by an *external* `Transformer` executing a `U.TransformationalMethod`. | Specs, CAD, theorem scripts, IaC SCRs. |
| **Run‑Time** | *Tᴿ* | Interval(s) during which the holon **executes its own `OperationalMethod`s** and is assumed structurally stable (self‑maintenance allowed). | Telemetry, transaction logs, field data, physical wear. |

**Temporal invariants**

```text
Tᴰ ∩ Tᴿ = ∅                     (never overlap)
Tᴰ ∪ Tᴿ = worldline(holon)      (cover full existence)
version(n+1) created only in Tᴰₙ (monotonic lineage)
````

#### Open‑Ended Evolution Principle

A holon may repeat the cycle *ad infinitum*:

```
(H₀ in Tᴿ₀) → observe → Δspec in Tᴰ₁ → build → H₁ in Tᴿ₁ → …
```

*Observation itself is a transformation*:
An **External Transformer** (`U.System` playing `transformerRole ⊑ TransformerRole`)
executes a **measurement method** whose *output* is an epistemic holon
containing observations.  Thus the traditional “External Observer Pattern” collapses into
the universal external Transformer pattern.

### Archetypal Grounding

| Phase                 | Pump‑v2 (`U.System`)                                                                         | Proof‑v2 (`U.Episteme`)                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design‑Time**       | 3‑D CAD + G‑code; stress‑sim config.                                                         | Lean/Coq script of theorem; dependency graph.                                           |
| **Run‑Time**          | Pump circulates coolant under `OperatePump` method.                                          | Theorem cited & reused; runtime is “being relied on”.                                   |
| **Run → Design loop** | Sensor data shows cavitation; anomaly report produced by monitoring server (`transformerRole`). | New experiment contradicts corollary; lab apparatus + scientists act as `transformerRole`. |
| **Design → Run loop** | Engineers author Pump‑v3 spec, printer (`TransformerRole`) fabricates it.                    | Community revises proof, proof‑assistant (`TransformerRole`) verifies Proof‑v3.         |

*(Diagrammatic lineage table omitted for brevity but included in annex.)*

### Conformance Checklist  

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑A.4.1** | Every `U.Holon` **MUST** be tagged with its current temporal scope (*Tᴰ* or *Tᴿ*). | Eliminates blueprint/reality ambiguity. |
| **CC‑A.4.2** | A transition from *Tᴰ* → *Tᴿ* **SHALL** be modeled as `executes(Transformer, U.TransformationalMethod)`. | Guarantees physical grounding of instantiation. |
| **CC‑A.4.3** | A transition from *Tᴿ* → *Tᴰ* **SHALL** be modeled as `executes(transformerRole, U.TransformationalMethod)` producing an observational `U.Episteme`. | Ensures observation is treated as transformation. |
| **CC‑A.4.4** | `Tᴰ ∩ Tᴿ = ∅` and the concatenated intervals **MUST** equal the holon’s worldline. | Guards against illicit overlap. |
| **CC‑A.4.5** | Each new design version **MUST** reference (`refinesVersion`) exactly one predecessor or declare `firstVersion = true`. | Enforces monotonic lineage for auditability. |

---

### Consequences  

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Audit‑Ready engineering workflow** – Every state and change is explicitly typed, timed, and causally linked to a physical system/Tramsformer. | Additional metadata tagging; mitigated by templates in Authoring Guide (E 8). |
| **Unified View of Build & Measure** – Observation, test, simulation, maintenance, and fabrication all share one mechanism. | Requires modelers to think in terms of Transformers even for “passive” sensing; mitigated by role libraries (`transformerRole`, `CalibratorRole`, etc.). |
| **Foundation for Learning Loops** – Enables higher patterns (e.g., B 4 Canonical Evolution Loop, D 3 Trust Calculus) to reason over evidence accrual and version fitness, including self-modification. | None significant—temporal scoping is already needed for safety‑critical provenance. |

---

### Rationale (extended)  

1. **Why separate scopes?**  
   Real‑world artefacts SCR the *as‑intended* versus *as‑is* gap.
   By formalising that gap, FPF prevents silent assumption of perfect
   fidelity and allows quantified error (`U.Error`) to drive evolution.

2. **Why treat observation as transformation?**  
   Physics tells us measurement changes state (energy, information, even
   quantum collapse).  Making the observer just another `Transformer`
   means: no special metaphysics, full energy/provenance accounting,
   seamless tie‑in with Constructor Theory (see A 3 Rationale §2).

3. **Why insist on open‑endedness?**  
   *Perfect* finality is unattainable outside mathematics mandates that holons must be *improvable* in principle; this pattern
   encodes that mandate structurally: version n+1 is always possible.

4. **Why no overlap (*Tᴰ* ∩ *Tᴿ*)?**  
   The instant a holon is mutable (design) it ceases to be the “same”
   operational asset relied upon for guarantees.  Overlap would break
   trust calculations and violate A.7 Strict Distinction.

This pattern therefore realises three core principles in concert:

* **Temporal Duality** – explicit tagging of states.  
* **Open‑Ended Evolution** – guaranteed pathway for refinement.  
* **Ontological Parsimony** – one mechanism (Transformer) for all
  state changes, avoiding specialised “observer” or “installer” types.

> *“Blueprints dream; instances speak.  
> Evolution is the conversation between them.”*

## A.5 Open‑Ended Kernel & Architheory Layering \[A] 

### Problem frame

FPF’s ambition is to act as an *“operating system for thought.”*
That ambition can only be realised if the framework:

* **(i)** remains *stable* and *self‑consistent* over multi‑decade timespans;
* **(ii)** *invites*, rather than resists, the continual influx of new disciplinary knowledge; and
* **(iii)** allows multiple, even competing, explanatory lenses to coexist without forcing a “winner‑takes‑all” unification.

Historically, grand “total” ontologies—Aristotle’s *Categories*, Carnap’s *Logical Construction of the World*, Bunge’s *TOE*—failed precisely because each tried to embed every domain’s primitives directly into a single monolith.  Once the monolith cracked under domain pressure, the whole edifice became unmaintainable.

### Problem

If FPF were to let **domain‑specific primitives creep into its Kernel**, two pathologies would follow:

| Pathology               | Manifestation                                                                                                                  | Breach of Constitution                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kernel Bloat**        | Every new field (e.g. synthetic biology) adds bespoke `U.Type`s → Core size explodes, review surface becomes unscalable.       | Violates **C‑5 Ontological Parsimony**; erodes **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**. |
| **Conceptual Gridlock** | Conflicting axioms (deterministic thermodynamics vs. indeterministic econ‑metrics) must fight for space in the same namespace. | Breaks **C‑3 Cross‑Scale Consistency**; triggers chronic DRR deadlock.     |

A *minimal, extensible* design is therefore mandatory.

### Forces

| Force                            | Tension                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stability vs. Evolvability**   | Immutable core needed for trust ↔ constant domain innovation needed for relevance.                                       |
| **Universality vs. Specificity** | Single kernel language ↔ rich idioms for fields as diverse as robotics, jurisprudence, metabolomics.                     |
| **Parsimony vs. Coverage**       | Few primitives keep reasoning elegant ↔ framework must still model energy budgets, epistemic uncertainty, agentic goals. |

### Solution 

FPF adopts a **micro‑kernel hour‑glass** architecture consisting of a *strictly minimal* core plus an **infinite flat namespace of plug‑ins** called *architheories*. (The formal plug‑in Standard is defined in **A.6 Architheory Signature & Realisation**.)

**1 The Open‑Ended Kernel**
The Kernel’s *normative* content is frozen to three buckets only:

* **Foundational Ontology:** `Entity`, `Holon`, `Boundary`, `Role`, `design‑/run‑time`, etc. (A‑cluster, Part A).
* **Universal Reasoning Patterns:** Γ‑aggregation, MHT, Trust calculus, Canonical evolution loop, etc. (B‑cluster, Part B).
* **Ecosystem Standards:** Guard‑Rails (E‑cluster) and the Architheory Signature schema (A.6).

Everything else—physics, logic operators beyond minimal MODAL, resource semantics, agent decision calculus—is *expelled* to architheories.

**2 Architheory Layering**

+To manage this extensibility without creating chaos, FPF classifies all architheories into three mutually exclusive classes, each with a distinct role. This classification governs what an architheory is allowed to do.

| Class | Mnemonic | Conceptual Mandate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calculus** | **CAL** - *The Builder* | Introduces a new composite holon type and **exactly one** aggregation operator `Γ_*` that *constructs* such holons from parts. |
| **Logic** | **LOG** - *The Reasoner* | Adds rules of inference or proof patterns *about* existing holons. **It cannot create new composite holons** and thus exports no `Γ_*` operator. |
| **Characterization**| **CHR** - *The Observer* | Attaches metrics or descriptive properties to existing holons. **It neither constructs nor infers new holons** and exports no `Γ_*` operator. |

Each architheory (CAL / LOG / CHR):

* **extends** the Kernel by *importing* its primitives and *exporting* new, *typed* vocabularies;
* remains **self‑contained**—it must **not mutate** Kernel axioms (CC‑A.6.x);
* is versioned, compared, and substituted entirely via its *Signature* (public Standard) while permitting multiple *Realizations* (private axiom-sets).

Architheories therefore form the **“fat top & bottom”** of the hour‑glass:

```
          ┌──────────────────────────┐
          │  Unlimited Domain CALs   │  ← e.g. Resrc‑CAL, Agent‑CAL
          ├──────────────────────────┤
          │  Core CAL / LOG / CHR    │  ← Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Method‑CAL …
          ╞════════ Kernel (Part A+B) ╡
          │  Γ, MHT, Trust, etc.     │
          ├──────────────────────────┤
          │  Unlimited Tooling Real. │  ← simulators, proof assistants …
          └──────────────────────────┘
```

| **Domain CAL that extends the Kernel** | **Sys‑CAL** adds conservation laws, port semantics, resource/work hooks                                                                                                 | **KD‑CAL** adds F‑G‑R characteristics, provenance graph, trust metrics                                                                                                                    |
| **Resulting instance**                 | A fully specified CAD model of the pump that can be aggregated by Γ\_sys, analysed by LOG‑CAL, and costed by Resrc‑CAL – **without ever mutating the Kernel** | A fully formalised theory object that can be cited, aggregated, and challenged by KD‑CAL, validated by LOG‑CAL, scored by the Trust calculus – **again without Kernel change** |

This table demonstrates the *hour‑glass* architecture in action:
*Wide variety of concrete instances* → **narrow, stable Kernel neck** → *wide variety of analysis & tooling*.

### Rationale

*Micro‑kernels* succeeded in operating‑system research because they separated **immutable primitives** (threads, IPC) from **replaceable servers** (file‑systems, network stacks).
FPF adopts the same strategy:

* **Immutable primitives** → the Part A Kernel (holons, roles, transformer quartet, temporal scopes, constitutional C‑rules).
* **Replaceable servers** → architheories in Part C (each with its own calculus, logic, characterisation kit).

This delivers on **P‑4 (Open‑Ended Kernel)**, **P‑5 (Plugin Layering)** and keeps the framework aligned with modern proof‑assistant ecosystems (Lean’s *mathlib* vs. core).

The “hour‑glass” brings two further advantages:

1. **Pluralism with auditability** – rival CALs can coexist; the Kernel’s Trust pipeline (B.3) quantifies their evidence base.
2. **Future‑proofing** – if a genuinely new substrate (e.g., quantum knowledge objects) emerges, it plugs in at the bottom layer without touching Part A.

---

### Relations

* **Instantiates:** P‑4, P‑5, and relies on Guard‑Rails E.5 (especially Unidirectional Dependency).
* **Provides Standard for:** every entry in **Part C**; style enforced via **Architheory Signature & Realization (A .6)**.
* **Feeds:** Trans‑disciplinary reasoning operators in **Part B** – Γ, MHT, Trust, Evolution Loop all treat each CAL uniformly through the Kernel neck.

> *“A stable neck sustains an ever‑growing hour‑glass.”*

## A.6.0 — **U.Signature · Universal, law‑governed declaration for a SubjectKind on a BaseType**  \[A]

**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], kernel‑level and universal.  
**Placement.** Part A (Kernel), **before A.6** (“Architheory Signature & Realization”) and **A.6.1** (“U.Mechanism”).  
**Builds on.** **A.2.6** (USM: context slices & scopes), **E.8** (authoring order), **E.10** LEX-BUNDLE (registers, naming, stratification), **E.10.D1** D.CTX (Context discipline).
  
**Coordinates with.** **A.6** (architheory specialisation of signatures), **A.6.1** (mechanism as law-governed signature), **A.6.5** (`U.RelationSlotDiscipline` for n-ary arguments), **Part F** (Bridges & cross-context transport; naming). Conformance keywords: RFC 2119.

### 1 · Problem frame

FPF already uses “signatures” to stabilise public promises of **architheories** and, via **A.6.1**, of **mechanisms**. But authors also need stable, minimal declarations for **theories** (LOG), **methods** (operational families), and even **disciplines** (regulated vocabularies). Without **one** universal notion of signature:
* similar constructs proliferate under incompatible names;
    
* readers cannot tell what is **declared** (intension & laws) versus what is **implemented** (specification);
    
* cross‑context reuse lacks a canonical place to state **applicability** and **lawful vocabularies**.

E.8 demands a single authoring voice and section order; E.10 demands lexical discipline across strata. A.6.0 provides the common kernel shape these patterns presuppose.

### 2 · Problem

If each family (architheories, mechanisms, methods, disciplines) invents its own “signature”:

1. **Tight coupling.** Private definitions leak as public standards, breaking substitutability.
    
2. **Lexical drift.** The same surface label (e.g., *scope*, *normalization*) hides different laws.
    
3. **Scope opacity.** Applicability (where the words mean what) remains implicit, violating D.CTX.
    

### 3 · Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| **Universality vs. fitness** | One shape must fit **architheories**, **mechanisms**, **theories**, **methods**, **disciplines**, without over‑committing to any one of them. |
| **Intension vs. specification (I/D/S)** | Signatures declare **what** and **the laws** (intension), not recipes or test harnesses (specification). |
| **Simplicity vs. expressivity** | Keep the kernel small while leaving **normalized** slots for specialisations (e.g., Γ‑export in A.6; Transport in A.6.1). |  
| **Locality vs. transport** | Meaning is context‑local (D.CTX), yet cross‑context use must be explicit and auditable via Bridges without smuggling implementation. |

### 4 · Solution — **Define `U.Signature` once, reuse everywhere**

**Definition.** A **`U.Signature`** is a **public, law-governed declaration** for a named **SubjectKind** on a declared **BaseType**. Where quantification depends on context, the Signature **SHALL** expose an explicit **SliceSet** and **ExtentRule**. A Signature (i) introduces a **vocabulary** (types, relations, operators), (ii) states **laws** (axioms/invariants; no operational admissions), and (iii) records **applicability** (where and under which contextual assumptions the declarations hold). Dependencies (**imports**) are governed by specialisations (e.g., A.6) and are **not** part of the universal Block. **Discipline for argument-position typing is delegated to A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`: whenever the Vocabulary declares an n-ary relation or operator, SlotSpecs for its parameter positions SHALL be provided as in §4.1.1 and A.6.5.**

Where the **Vocabulary** introduces an **n‑ary relation or morphism**, the Signature **SHALL**, for each parameter position `i`, declare a `SlotSpec_i = ⟨SlotKind_i, ValueKind_i, refMode_i⟩` as defined in **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`**. SlotSpecs live inside the per‑relation parameter block of the **Vocabulary** row and **MUST NOT** introduce additional rows beyond the four‑row Signature Block.

**Arrow form (typing for MVPK).** Author a Signature as a **morphism**  
`SigDecl : ⟨SubjectBlock⟩ → ⟨Vocabulary × Laws × Applicability⟩`  
where `SubjectBlock = ⟨SubjectKind, BaseType, SliceSet, ExtentRule, ResultKind?⟩`. This makes `U.Signature` directly consumable by **E.17 MVPK** (publication of morphisms) without adding semantics on faces (no new claims; pins for any numeric content).

*Guard clarification (normative).* **Operational guard predicates** (run‑time or admission guards) **BELONG ONLY** to **A.6.1 Mechanisms**. A Signature may express **domain/type constraints** intensionally (e.g., restricting an operator’s domain) but **SHALL NOT** encode operational admissions.

*Guidance for deductive substrates.* Signatures that declare a **formal deductive substrate** (e.g., *FormalSubstrate*) MAY include, **as vocabulary elements**, an **EffectDiscipline** (algebraic/row/graded effect signatures) and **InferenceKind** enumerations; handler semantics are **out of scope** for Signatures (see §4.3). The universal block remains conceptual and contains **no** run‑time admissions or AdmissibilityConditions.

**Naming discipline.** The `Subject` **MUST** be a **single‑sense** noun phrase; avoid synonyms/aliases within the same Signature.

A `U.Signature` is **conceptual**: it contains **no implementation, no packaging/CI metadata, and no Γ‑builders**. Γ‑export, if any, is governed by **A.6** and only for architheories with `classification=CAL`.

#### 4.1 · The **Signature Block (universal form)**

The **four conceptual rows** (“SubjectBlock / Vocabulary / Laws / Applicability”) give a repeatable, holon‑stable pattern across mathematics → physics → engineering:  
* **SubjectBlock** = *what it’s about + how quantified* (axiomatics + domain of interpretation),  
* **Vocabulary/Laws** = *principles/laws* (postulates & constraints),  
* **Applicability** = *where they hold in practice* (bounded context & time).

Every `U.Signature` **SHALL** present a **four‑row conceptual block** (names are universal; family‑specific aliases are mapped below):

1. **SubjectBlock** — ⟨**SubjectKind**, **BaseType**, **SliceSet**, **ExtentRule**, **ResultKind?**⟩.  
   *SubjectKind* names the intensional subject (C.3); *BaseType* is the `U.Type` the signature ranges over (CHR Spaces appear here **as types**, not as field names); *SliceSet* addresses the quantification domain (USM; e.g., **ContextSliceSet**); *ExtentRule* computes `Extension(SubjectKind, slice)` (C.3.2); *ResultKind?* (optional) is the intensional kind of outputs.  
   **Editorial split (allowed).** Authors **MAY** render the **SubjectBlock** as two adjacent lines — **Subject** *(SubjectKind, BaseType)* and **Quantification** *(SliceSet, ExtentRule, ResultKind?)* — **without changing semantics**. Even when visually split, SubjectBlock counts as **one** conceptual row.

   **Semantic roles of the SubjectBlock kinds (informative)**
   * **SubjectKind (intent).** The intensional “describedEntity” of the signature (C.3.1), ordered by `⊑`. It carries no Scope.
   * **BaseType (carrier).** The `U.Type` over which values/objects are ranged. In CHR regimes this may be a `U.CharacteristicSpace` **type**; elsewhere it is a set‑typed `U.Type`.
   * **SliceSet (addressability).** The addressable set of `U.ContextSlice`s (USM). It identifies where **extent** is computed; it is not a “space” unless CHR.
   * **ExtentRule (extent).** A rule yielding `Extension(SubjectKind, slice)` (C.3.2); this is the quantifier’s domain, computed per slice.
   * **ResultKind? (outputs).** Optional: the intensional kind of the outputs of the operations declared in *Vocabulary* (use when outputs differ in kind from the SubjectKind).
    
2. **Vocabulary** — names and sorts of the public **types / relations / operators** this signature commits to (no handler semantics; no AdmissibilityConditions). For each **n‑ary relation or morphism** in the Vocabulary, parameters **SHALL** be declared via **SlotSpecs** `SlotSpec_i = ⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩` per **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`**. SlotKinds and RefKinds **MUST** follow the `…Slot` / `…Ref` lexical discipline in **A.6.5** and **E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE)**; ValueKinds **MUST** remain free of these suffixes. For each **n‑ary relation or morphism** in the Vocabulary, parameters **SHALL** be declared via **SlotSpecs**
  
3. **Laws (Axioms/Invariants)** — equations and order/closure laws that are context‑local truths under the stated Applicability (no proofs here). **Operational guard predicates belong to Mechanisms (A.6.1)**, not to Signatures.
    
4. **Applicability (Scope & Context)** — conditions under which the laws are valid (bounded context, plane, stance, time notions). Applicability **MUST** bind a **`U.BoundedContext`** (D.CTX). Cross‑context use **MUST NOT** be implicit; if intended, **name** the Bridge (conceptual reference only). When numeric comparability is implied, **bind** legality to **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** (normalize‑then‑compare; lawful scales/units).
    
*Mapping to existing families (normative aliases).*  
— **A.6.1 (Mechanism).** *SubjectBlock* ↔ **SubjectKind/BaseType/…**; *Vocabulary* ↔ **OperatorAlgebra**; *Laws* ↔ **LawSet**; *Applicability* remains contextual; **AdmissibilityConditions** — separate field of mechanism (not in the `U.Signature`).  
— **A.6 (Architheory).** A.6 **adds** an adjacent **Architheory View** preserving **Imports / Derivations / Invariants / BelongsToAssurance**. The **universal Block remains the source-of-truth**; the view is a projection and **MUST NOT** introduce fields not derivable from the Block.  
— **Task/Problem/Discipline signatures (C.22, G-cluster).** These **SHALL** be introduced as **species of `U.Signature`** that reuse the same four-row Block (SubjectBlock / Vocabulary / Laws / Applicability); any extra per-family views are projections only (no new conceptual rows).

##### 4.1.1 · SlotSpec for argument positions (normative; see A.6.5)

For every **n‑ary relation or operator** declared in the **Vocabulary** row, the Signature **SHALL** assign, to each argument position, a **SlotSpec** triple:

```text
+SlotSpec_i := ⟨SlotKind_i, ValueKind_i, refMode_i⟩
```

where:
* **SlotKind_i** is a named position in the relation/operator (Tech name with `…Slot` suffix) whose semantics are documented (see A.6.5).
* **ValueKind_i** is the FPF type (`U.Kind` or kernel‑level type) of admissible occupants at that position.
* **refMode_i** is either `ByValue` or a **RefKind** (e.g., `U.EntityRef`, `U.HolonRef`), indicating whether the episteme stores values directly or references/identifiers.

Full discipline and lexical rules for **SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind** are given in A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` and E.10 (§8.1). A.6.0 requires that every vocabulary‑level relation or operator that takes arguments **declare** these SlotSpecs; downstream patterns MAY provide templates for common shapes (e.g., episteme slots in C.2.1).

**Mini‑example (informative).** For an episteme kind `ModelEvaluationResultKind`, a simplified episteme might expose:
* `describedEntityRef : U.MethodRef`
* `datasetRef : U.EntityRef`
* `metricRef : U.CharacteristicRef`
* `groundingHolonRef : U.HolonRef`
* `claimGraph : U.ClaimGraph`

An authorial SlotSpec table then reads:

| Parameter (episteme field)   | SlotKind              | ValueKind          | refMode                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `describedEntityRef`   | `DescribedEntitySlot` | `U.Method`         | `U.MethodRef`          |
| `datasetRef`           | `DatasetSlot`         | `U.Entity`         | `U.EntityRef`          |
| `metricRef`            | `MetricSlot`          | `U.Characteristic` | `U.CharacteristicRef`  |
| `groundingHolonRef`    | `GroundingHolonSlot`  | `U.Holon`          | `U.HolonRef`           |
| `claimGraph`           | `ClaimGraphSlot`      | `U.ClaimGraph`     | `ByValue`              |

This example illustrates the intended reading: **parameters are typed twice**—once by their **ValueKind** (what sort of thing occupies the position) and once by **refMode** (by‑value or which RefKind). SlotKinds (with `…Slot` suffix) give stable names for substitution laws and describedEntity statements across patterns.

#### 4.2 · Profile specialisations (normative; structure‑preserving)
To enable first‑principles layers without minting new Kernel kinds, apply **profiles** to `U.Signature`:

* **`profile = FormalSubstrate`** — *formal‑deductive layer*  
  **Vocabulary:** `TermRegister` (ref‑only), **InferenceKinds** (ref‑only), **EffectDiscipline** (operation/effect signatures).  
  **Laws:** equational/structural axioms of the calculus; **no handler semantics**.  
  **Applicability:** binds a `U.BoundedContext` at the **concept‑plane**; **no units/ReferencePlane/Transport** on faces.  
  **MVPK pins:** **`No‑Realization` pin (mandatory)** on `PlainView`/`TechCard` asserting that handler semantics live only in **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism::U.EffectRealization`**.  
  **Faces:** On MVPK faces, **`InferenceKindsAllowed`** MAY present a **ref‑only subset** of the enumerated **`InferenceKinds`**; Signatures do not add handler semantics.

* **`profile = PrincipleFrame`** — *postulates + measurability intent (CHR‑binding)*  
  **Vocabulary:** **PostulateSet** (in the calculus imported), **CHR‑Binding presence** (ref‑only to characteristics/observation profiles), **Ontology anchors** (ref‑only to substrate types/morphisms used to name subject‑matter entities).  
  **Laws:** timeless/order‑free invariants; **no operational admissions**.  
  **Applicability:** binds a `U.BoundedContext`; **Signatures SHALL NOT publish units/ReferencePlane/ComparatorSet/Transport** (first mention is in **UNM**). ** 
  **MVPK pins:** **`NoReferencePlaneOnSignature`** (alias: **`NoReferencePlaneOnPF`**) and **`UNM‑priority`** (units/planes/comparators/Transport are declared only by **`U.ContextNormalization`** and cited by edition/ref‑id where needed).

**Profile morphism discipline.** See §4.6 for the **structure‑preserving morphism** requirements for profile application.

#### 4.3 · Effect‑discipline vs handler semantics (normative split)

If a Signature’s **Vocabulary** includes an **EffectDiscipline** (operation/effect signatures), the Signature **SHALL NOT** declare **handler semantics** or any **EffectRealization**. Such realizations are authored only under **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`** and cited by **ref‑id** on faces where needed. This mirrors the modern algebraic‑effects separation between *operation signatures* and *handlers* while keeping A.6.0 purely conceptual.

#### 4.4 · Authoring rules (I/D/S‑aware; lexically disciplined)

* **I/D/S separation.** A signature **states intension and laws**; Realizations (if any) carry **specifications**. Do not mix tutorial text or operational recipes into the Block. Do **not** include **AdmissibilityConditions** or run‑time admissions here.
* **Context discipline.** Bind Applicability to a **`U.BoundedContext`**. If cross‑context use is intended, **name** the crossing and **reference** the Bridge (Part F/B); A.6.0 does **not** prescribe **compatibility/loss tables (CL, including `CL^plane`)** or penalty formulas.
* **Stratification.** Use LEX‑BUNDLE registers and strata; do not redefine Kernel names in lower strata (no cross‑bleed).  
* **Imports location.** If your family requires an explicit **imports** list (e.g., A.6 Architheory), place it in the **Signature header** or the **family‑specific view**, not inside the universal four‑row Block.

* **Token hygiene.** Do **not** mint new `U.*` tokens inside a Signature without a **DRR**; prefer referencing existing Kernel/Architheory `U.Type`s. 

*MVPK publication discipline for Signatures (normative).* When publishing a `U.Signature` via MVPK (E.17), faces **SHALL** be typed projections that add **no new claims**; any numeric/comparable statement **MUST** pin unit/scale/reference‑plane/**EditionId** to **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** where applicable. For deductive substrates, faces **MUST** carry a **No‑Realization pin** (handlers/realizers absent). For Principle‑level signatures, faces **MUST NOT** introduce units/ReferencePlane/Transport (first mention occurs in UNM).

#### 4.5 · Specialisation knobs (for downstream patterns)

A.6.0 exposes **three** conceptual knobs; specialisations (A.6, A.6.1, method/discipline specs) may **tighten** them:

1. **Builder policy.** Whether a signature may commit to a builder `Γ_*` is not decided here; **A.6** governs this for architheories (`classification=CAL` only).
    
2. **Transport clause.** If cross‑context/plane use is part of the design, the signature **may declare** a conceptual Transport clause; **A.6.1** gives a concrete schema (Bridge, **CL/CL^k/CL^plane**—Bridges per **F.9**, penalties per **B.3**, **CL^plane** per **C.2.1**), but A.6.0 remains agnostic about penalty shapes.
    
3. **Morphisms.** Families may define `SigMorph` (refinement, conservative extension, equivalence, quotient, product) to relate signatures; **A.6.1** instantiates this for mechanisms. Where such morphisms, or downstream **substitution / retargeting** laws (e.g., **A.6.2–A.6.4**), act on **n‑ary relations or morphisms**, they **SHALL** express their read/write/retargeting discipline in terms of **SlotSpecs**  (SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind) rather than unnamed parameter indices, using **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`** as the normative slot calculus.

#### 4.6 · Profile‑specialisation as a structure‑preserving morphism (normative)
Profile application `ι_profile : U.Signature → U.Signature(profile=…)` **SHALL** be a **structure‑preserving morphism**:
— **SubjectBlock** is preserved up to α‑renaming (SubjectKind/BaseType unchanged; ResultKind? only added when it exists in the universal intent).  
— **Vocabulary** is **monotone** (adds or refines names/sorts without contradicting existing ones).  
— **Laws** are **monotone** (add/strengthen axioms; never weaken).  
— **Applicability** is **restrictive** (binds or tightens `U.BoundedContext`; never widens implicitly).  
— No **AdmissibilityConditions**, **operational guards**, or **handler semantics** are introduced by the profile (those live under **A.6.1**).  
This makes `profile=FormalSubstrate` and `profile=PrincipleFrame` *morphisms* in the sense of kernel specialisation and supports SigMorph reasoning (refinement/conservative extension).
   
### 5 · Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

| quartet Element | `U.System` Example — **Grammar of Motions** | `U.Episteme` Example — **Normalization Family** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SubjectBlock** | **Subject:** SubjectKind=`MotionGrammar`; BaseType=`U.System:TrajectorySpace`. **Quantification:** SliceSet=`U.ContextSliceSet`; ExtentRule=`admissible motion words per slice (kinematics & domain restrictions)`; ResultKind?=`Language[Segment]`. | **Subject:** SubjectKind=`NormalizationMethod‑Class`; BaseType=`U.Episteme:ChartFamily` (one `U.BoundedContext`). **Quantification:** SliceSet=`U.ContextSliceSet`; ExtentRule=`admissible method instances per slice (edition+validity)`; ResultKind?=`NormalizedChart`. |
| **Vocabulary** | Types: `Pose`, `Segment`; Operators: `concat`, `reverse`, `sample` (any Γ‑builder is governed by A.6). | Operators: `apply(method)`, `compose`, `quotient(≡)`. |
| **Laws (Invariants/Constraints)** | Closure of `concat`; associativity; time‑monotone sampling; **`reverse` is declared only for holonomic arms (domain restriction)**. | Ratio→positive‑scalar; Interval→affine; Ordinal→monotone; Nominal→categorical; LUT(+uncertainty). |
| **Applicability (Scope & Context)** | Context: *industrial robotics*; stance: design; time notion: discrete ticks. Cross‑context transport not declared. | Context: *clinical metrics*; stance: analysis; validity windows declared; cross‑context transport via Bridge (concept only; details per A.6.1). Numeric comparability bound to CHR/CG‑Spec. |

*Why these two?* E.8 requires pairs from **U.System** and **U.Episteme** to demonstrate trans‑disciplinary universality.

### 6 · Bias‑Annotation (lenses & defaults)

* **Local‑first meaning.** Laws are **local** to the named Context; cross‑context use must be explicit (Bridge), never implicit.
    
* **No illicit scalarisation.** If numbers appear, legal comparability follows **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR**; **no ordinal means**, **partial orders return sets**; unit/scale alignment is explicit.
    
* **Register hygiene.** Keep Tech vs Plain register pairs; avoid tooling/vendor talk in Kernel prose (E.10).
  
### 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑1** | A conformant text labelled **`U.Signature`** **SHALL** expose the **four‑row Signature Block**: *SubjectBlock; Vocabulary; Laws; Applicability*. A visual split of SubjectBlock into **Subject**/**Quantification** lines is allowed; it still counts as **one** conceptual row. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑2** | The Block is **conceptual only** (no packaging/CI metadata, no machine schemas, **no Γ**). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑3** | Applicability **binds** a `U.BoundedContext`; if cross‑context use is intended, a **Transport clause** is *named* (Bridge reference) without re‑stating Part F/B.3 details (including any **CL^plane**). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑4** | Where numeric comparability is implied, Applicability **binds** to **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** legality (normalize‑then‑compare; scale/unit alignment). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑5** | Families that specialise A.6.0 (e.g., **A.6**, **A.6.1**) **MAY** add constraints (e.g., Γ‑export policy; penalty routing) and **MAY** add a family‑specific view (e.g., the Architheory View) but **MUST NOT** contradict A.6.0’s separation of intension vs specification. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑6** | Under E.10/E.8, tokens respect strata/registers; Kernel names are not redefined in Architheory/Context prose (Part F naming discipline applies). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑7** | The **Laws** row contains **axioms/invariants** only; **AdmissibilityConditions** and operational admissions **MUST** appear only in **A.6.1 Mechanisms** that consume this Signature. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑8 (No‑Realization on Signatures with EffectDiscipline).** | If **EffectDiscipline** appears in **Vocabulary**, faces **MUST** carry a **`No‑Realization` pin** and **MUST NOT** publish handler semantics; any **EffectRealization** is referenced (A.6.1) by id only. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑9 (CHR‑binding without units/Transport).** | Signatures that declare **measurability intent** (e.g., PrincipleFrame) **SHALL NOT** publish **units, ReferencePlane, ComparatorSet, or Transport**; those are declared only by **UNM** and cited by edition/ref‑id where consumers require numeric comparability. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑10 (UNM‑priority on faces).** | Any numeric/comparable claim on a Signature face **pins** **CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet edition ids** and, where scale/plane conversion occurs, **UNM.TransportRegistry edition** with **CL/CL^plane policy‑ids**; **penalties route to R/R_eff only**. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑11 (Bridge‑only crossings).** | Cross‑context/plane reuse of Signature claims **MUST** name a **Bridge** (UTS row) and **MUST NOT** imply implicit equivalence by label; losses are recorded via **CL** (penalties → **R**). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑12 (Profile conformance).** | If the Signature declares `profile=FormalSubstrate` or `profile=PrincipleFrame`, the corresponding **profile pins** in §4.2 are **mandatory**; failure to emit them makes the Signature **non‑conformant** for that profile. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑13 (Profile morphism discipline).** | Applying a profile **SHALL** satisfy §4.6 (structure‑preserving morphism: SubjectBlock preserved, Vocabulary/Laws monotone, Applicability restrictive, no admissibility/handlers). |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑14 (SlotSpec for argument positions).** | Any `U.Signature` whose **Vocabulary** declares n‑ary relations or operators **SHALL** provide, for each argument position, a **SlotSpec** triple `⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩` (with `refMode ∈ {ByValue \| RefKind}`) as per A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑15 (Slot/Ref lexical discipline on signatures).** | Names of SlotKinds and RefKinds used in SlotSpecs **MUST** obey E.10/A.6.5 lexical guards: tokens ending with **`…Slot`** denote SlotKinds only; tokens ending with **`…Ref`** denote either RefKinds or episteme fields whose type is a RefKind; no ValueKind ends with these suffixes. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑16 (SlotSpecs for n‑ary relations).** | Any `U.Signature` whose **Vocabulary** declares an **n‑ary relation or morphism** **SHALL** assign to each parameter position a `SlotSpec_i = ⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩` as defined in **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`**; SlotSpecs live inside the Vocabulary row’s per‑relation parameter block and **MUST NOT** introduce additional rows beyond the four‑row Block. |
| **CC‑A.6.0‑17 (SlotSpec‑based substitution laws).** | Specialisations of A.6.0 that define **substitution, retargeting, or profile application** over n‑ary relations/morphisms (e.g., **A.6.2–A.6.4**) **SHALL** phrase their rules in terms of **SlotSpecs** (SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind) rather than unnamed parameter indices and **SHALL** obey the `…Slot` / `…Ref` lexical discipline in **A.6.5** and **F.18**. |

### 8 · Consequences

* **Uniform kernel shape.** Authors can define **architheory**, **mechanism**, **method**, **discipline**, or **theory** signatures without inventing new templates.
    
* **Hard decoupling.** A.6 can continue to guarantee substitutable Realizations behind a stable Signature; A.6.1 can continue to guarantee law‑governed operations with explicit guard surfaces.
    
**Didactic cohesion.** Readers see the same four conceptual rows across the spec, satisfying E.8’s comparability goal.

### 9 · Rationale

**Why “SubjectBlock”?** A.6.1 showed that making the **carrier explicit** (here: *BaseType* — the carrier type) avoids category mistakes when moving between domains (e.g., *set‑algebra on context slices* vs *equivalence‑classes of normalisations*). A.6.0 lifts this to the kernel so every signature can declare **what it is about** before saying **what it provides**.
**Why one universal Block?** A.6 already proved the value of a compact **Signature Block** (Imports/Derivations/Invariants/Assurance). A.6.0 factors out the **conceptual core**—rephrased as “SubjectBlock / Vocabulary / Laws / Applicability”—so A.6 can **map** its four rows onto this universal frame without changing existing architheories.

**Informative echoes (post‑2015 SoTA).**  
— **Algebraic effects & handlers** (OCaml 5, Koka, Effekt, Links): *operation signatures + handler laws* mirror **Vocabulary + Laws** while keeping implementations separate.  
— **Session/behavioural types** (2016–2024): protocol/admissibility laws parallel the **Laws** row (at mechanism level).  
— **Graded/row‑polymorphic effects** (Granule, row‑effects): inform the **EffectDiscipline** vocabulary and equational laws.

**Profiles rationale (informative).**  
— **FormalSubstrate.** Captures *mathematical language + inference kinds + effect signatures* at the **concept plane**, ensuring the calculus stays independent from handler/realization choices; consuming mechanisms (A.6.1) provide **EffectRealization** only by reference.  
— **PrincipleFrame.** Captures *postulates/invariants + measurability intent (CHR binding)* without committing to **units/planes/Transport**, which are authored centrally in **UNM** so that comparisons remain lawful and edition‑pinned.

### 10 · Relations

* **Specialises / is specialised by:** **A.6** (adds Γ‑export policy; imports DAG; architheory layering) and **A.6.1** (adds **OperatorAlgebra/LawSet/AdmissibilityConditions/Transport** for mechanisms).  
* **Constrained by:** E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE (registers, strata); D.CTX for Context binding; **Part F** (Bridges & cross‑context transport; naming).
* **Consumed by (profiles):** **`U.FormalSubstrate`** and **`U.PrincipleFrame`** specialisations of `U.Signature` on the principled path; **UNM** (Context Normalization) remains the **single source of truth** for **CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet/Transport** editions that Signature consumers pin on faces.

* **Enables:** uniform authoring and comparison of signatures across Part C families, methods, and discipline glossaries (Part F).

## A.6 — Architheory Signature & Realization  \[A]

### 1. Problem frame

FPF’s architecture is a modular ecosystem of **architheories** (CAL/LOG/CHR) that extend a slim Kernel. To keep composition stable and comparable, each architheory **publishes a public Signature** (the Standard) and provides one or more **Realizations** (private implementations).  
**A.6 as a specialisation.** This pattern is the **architheory‑specific specialisation** of **A.6.0 `U.Signature`** and coordinates cross‑context use with **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`** (Bridge/CL per **F.9**; penalties route to **R/R_eff** only per **B.3**; **F/G** invariant; **CL^plane** per **C.2.1 CHR:ReferencePlane**).


### 2.  Problem

When Signatures (interface) leak implementation, the ecosystem becomes brittle: (1) substitutability breaks, (2) imports entangle, (3) cross‑context use becomes implicit and unauditable.

### 3. Forces
| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| **Stability vs. evolution** | Keep public promises stable while allowing private Realizations to evolve. |
| **Universality vs. fitness** | One Signature shape across CAL/LOG/CHR vs architheory‑specific vocabularies. |
| **Intension vs. specification** | Signatures state *what & laws*; Realizations carry *how/tests*. |
| **Locality vs. transport** | Context‑local semantics vs explicit, auditable Bridge‑only crossings (R‑only penalties). |
 
### 4. Solution

#### 4.1. `U.ArchitheorySignature` — *the public Standard*

A **Signature** states **what** an architheory offers—its vocabulary, laws, and applicability—**without** embedding implementation or build metadata. It is the stable unit that other architheories import.

#### 4.2. `U.ArchitheoryRealization` — *the private implementation*

A **Realization** satisfies the Signature while remaining opaque. Multiple Realizations may co‑exist; they **may tighten** (never relax) the Signature’s laws (Liskov‑style substitutability).

#### 4.3 · Signature Block — **A.6.0 alignment** and **Architheory View**

Every architheory **SHALL** publish **two adjacent views** of its public contract:
1) the **universal** A.6.0 `U.Signature` Block (*SubjectBlock; Vocabulary; Laws; Applicability*), and  
2) an **Architheory View** that preserves the pass interface used across Part C: **Imports / Derivations / Invariants / BelongsToAssurance**.
This ensures both cross‑family uniformity **and** compatibility with existing architheory architecture. The **universal Block remains the source‑of‑truth**; the **Architheory View is a projection** that MUST NOT introduce fields not derivable from the Block (e.g., no hidden AdmissibilityConditions; no Γ in LOG/CHR).

| `U.Signature` row (A.6.0)          | A.6 alias / where to author it                                           |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SubjectBlock**            | One‑line declaration above the block (**SubjectKind + BaseType**; may be visually split into **Subject/Quantification**; avoid “governed” wording) |
| **Vocabulary**                     | **Derivations** (public types/relations/operators that the theory contributes) |
| **Laws (Invariants/Guards)**       | **Invariants** (law statements; proofs live in Realizations)             |
| **Applicability (Scope & Context)**| **BelongsToAssurance** + context note in the header; bind a `U.BoundedContext` where relevant; numeric comparability **binds** to **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** (normalize‑then‑compare; lawful units/scales). |

**Architheory View (mandatory alongside the universal view):**
* **Imports** — required `U.Type`s/relations already present or produced by earlier passes.  
* **Derivations** — new `U.Type`s/relations/operators the architheory contributes.  
* **Invariants** — law statements (proofs in Realizations).  
* **BelongsToAssurance** — {Typing | Verification | Validation}.
 
*Prohibition.* The Signature block is **conceptual**: no packaging/CI/tooling metadata (LEX firewall), no Γ‑builders (except as permitted below for CAL).

#### 4.4 · Γ‑export policy and layering

* A **CAL** architheory **SHALL** export **exactly one** aggregation/builder `Γ`. The **`Γ` identifier MUST be namespaced** under the architheory `id` (e.g., `ArchitheoryId.Γ`) to avoid collisions.
* **LOG** and **CHR** architheories **SHALL NOT** export `Γ`.  
* Import layering **SHALL** respect the holonic stack: **LOG/CHR may import CAL; CAL may import CAL**; import graphs are **acyclic** and respect **LEX‑BUNDLE** strata (Kernel → Architheory → Context → Instance); no cross‑bleed.

#### 4.5 · Signature header 

Each Signature begins with:  
`id` (PascalCase), `version` (SemVer), `status` (draft/review/stable/deprecated), `classification` (CAL/LOG/CHR), `imports` (list), `provides` (list, including Γ if CAL).  
If **SubjectBlock** are non‑trivial, add a one‑liner in the header (or immediately above the block).

### 5 · Transport & Cross‑Context Use (coordination with A.6.1)

Signatures **SHALL NOT** restate Bridge/CL mechanics. If cross‑context/plane use is intended, the Signature **names** the Bridge conceptually. Semantics are governed by **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`**; **Bridges** are specified in **F.9**; **CL/CL^k** and **Φ/Ψ** penalty calculus live in **B.3**; **CL^plane** follows **C.2.1 CHR:ReferencePlane**. No implicit “latest”; time‑sensitive guards require an explicit **Γ_time** policy in the consuming mechanism.

### 6. Normative Relations

`implements(Realization, Signature)` (mandatory, one‑way) · `imports(Signatureᵢ, Signatureⱼ)` (DAG) · `provides(Signature, U.Type ∪ Operator)` (public namespace).

### 7 Archetypal Grounding

Provide a brief pair of examples (Work/System; Knowledge/Episteme) that name SubjectBlock, show Vocabulary and Laws, and state Applicability/Context. Keep proofs out of the Signature.

### 8 Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑A6.1** | Every architheory **MUST** declare exactly one `Signature`. |
| **CC‑A6.2** | Every architheory **MUST** provide ≥ 1 `Realization` consistent with its Signature. |
| **CC‑A6.3** | The global graph of `imports` **MUST** be acyclic. |
| **CC‑A6.4** | Realizations **MUST NOT** reference internals of other architheories; only their Signatures. |
| **CC‑A6.5** | A Signature’s `provides` **MUST NOT** redeclare `U.Type`s already exported by transitive `imports`. |
| **CC‑A6.6** | Realizations **MAY tighten** but **MUST NOT relax** Signature laws (Liskov‑style). |
| **CC‑A6.7** | If multiple Realizations exist, authors **SHOULD** provide a short trade‑off rationale. |
| **CC‑A6.8** | The Signature **MUST** include an explicit **A.6.0 alignment** mapping (table or one‑liners). |
| **CC‑A6.9** | Where numeric comparability is implied, **bind** legality to **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** (normalize‑then‑compare; lawful units/scales; no ordinal means). |
| **CC‑A6.10** | Any intended cross‑context/plane use **MUST** name the Bridge and defer semantics to **A.6.1**/**Part F**; penalties route to **R/R_eff** only. |  
| **CC‑A6.11** | If `classification = CAL` and a `Γ` is exported, its identifier **MUST** be namespaced under the architheory `id`. |
| **CC‑A6.12** | **Both views** of the Signature are present: the universal A.6.0 Block **and** the **Architheory View (Imports/Derivations/Invariants/BelongsToAssurance)** placed adjacently. |

**Author-facing:**
* [ ] The **two** Signature views are present (A.6.0 Block **and** Architheory View).  
* [ ] If `classification = CAL`, **exactly one** Γ is named.  
* [ ] Imports point **down** the layering and remain **acyclic**.  
* [ ] Any referenced artefacts are anchored by SCR/RSCR identifiers (A.10).  
* [ ] An **A.6.0 alignment note** is provided (table or one‑liners as above).

### 9 Consequences

* **Hard decoupling** — Kernel stability is preserved; swapping a Realization never breaks dependents.  
* **In‑framework competition** — Alternative logics, physics, economic models can co‑exist under the same interface.  
* **Machine‑checkable composition** — Because imports form a DAG and `provides` are explicit, automated loaders can detect conflicts early.

### 10 Didactic Addendum — Benefits & Trade‑offs (informative)

| Benefit | What you get | Trade‑off / Guard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Universal shape (A.6.0 alignment)** | One 4‑row block across architheories, mechanisms, methods, disciplines. | Maintain **Intension vs. Specification** separation; no Γ in Signatures except CAL per A.6. |
| **Substitutability** | Multiple Realizations behind one Signature; safe swaps; Liskov‑style tightening allowed. | Relaxing laws is forbidden; otherwise mint a refined Signature or use **U.MechMorph** (A.6.1). |
| **Transport discipline** | **Bridge‑only** crossing; CL penalties route to **R/R_eff**; **F/G invariant**. | Crossings are **named**; no implicit “latest”; **Γ_time** where relevant. |
| **Numeric comparability sanity** | **normalize‑then‑compare** via **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR**; explicit unit/scale alignment. | **Partial orders return sets**; illegal scalarisation (e.g., ordinal means) is blocked. |
| **Layering predictability** | Exactly **one Γ** for **CAL**; **LOG/CHR** export none; **imports acyclic; no cross‑bleed across strata**. | Some constructs belong as **Mechanisms (A.6.1)**, not as architheories. |

### 11 Rationale

Why “Signature”? Familiar to engineers (function/type signatures) and to logicians (algebraic signatures). It is concise, neutral, and keeps the Kernel slim while enabling competing world‑views to co‑exist behind the same interface.

### 12 Relations

*Specialises / is specialised by*: **A.6.0 `U.Signature`**, **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`**.  
*Constrained by*: LEX‑BUNDLE (registers/strata), D.CTX (Context), Part F (Bridges & cross‑context transport; naming).

## **A.6.1 — U.Mechanism · Law‑governed application to a SubjectKind over a BaseType** \[A]

**One‑line summary.** A `U.Mechanism` is a **Signature with laws** applied to a declared **SubjectKind** over a **BaseType**, with explicit **operations**, **invariants/guards**, and a named **Transport** clause for cross‑context use. Transport is **Bridge‑only** (per **F.9**) with penalties routed to **R**/**R_eff** only (per **B.3**); **F/G** remain invariant; **CL^plane** follows **C.2.1 CHR:ReferencePlane**. Realizations **MAY** be published under **A.6** (Signature→Realization; **one Γ only if `classification=CAL`**; acyclic imports; opacity).

**Status.** Normative \[A\] in **Part A (Kernel)**.  

**Placement.** Immediately **after A.6** as **A.6.1**. **USM (A.2.6)** and **UNM (A.19/C.16)** become **instances conforming to A.6.1** (no semantic change to either).

### 1 · Problem frame

Give FPF **one uniform kernel shape** for things like **USM** (set‑algebra on context slices) and **UNM** (classes of admissible normalizations with ≡_UNM) so authors can **define, compare, refine, compose, and port** mechanisms **without re‑inventing the meta‑language**; all cross‑context use is **Bridge‑only** with **CL penalties to R/R_eff**, never to **F/G**.

### 2 · Problem 

Without a kernel abstraction, scope/normalization/comparison constructs proliferate with incompatible algebras and guard surfaces; cross‑context reuse lacks visible **Bridge/CL routing**; comparability drifts into **illegal scalarisation** (e.g., ordinal means). FPF already curbs this via **A.6** (Signature discipline), **USM** (scope algebra & Γ_time), **UNM** (normalize‑then‑compare), and **CG‑Spec** (lawful comparators/ScoringMethods)—but lacks a **common meta‑slot** for “mechanism.”

### 3 · Forces 

**Locality vs transport.** Semantics are **context‑local**; crossing contexts is **Bridge‑only** (Part F/B.3); penalties hit **R/R_eff**; **F/G** invariant.

**Expressivity vs legality.** Rich operators vs **CHR legality** and **CG‑Spec** (no ordinal averages; lawful unit alignment).

**Time determinacy.** Explicit **Γ_time**; no implicit *latest*. (Required in USM’s `ContextSlice`.)

**Signature hygiene.** Obey **A.6** (exactly one Γ from CAL, LOG/CHR export none; imports acyclic; realizations opaque).

### 4 · Solution

#### 4.1 **Mechanism Intension** 

A `U.Mechanism` **publishes**  
        `U.Mechanism.Intension := ⟨IntensionHeader, Imports,
                SubjectBlock := ⟨SubjectKind, BaseType, SliceSet, ExtentRule, ResultKind?⟩,
                ParamKinds, OperatorAlgebra, LawSet, AdmissibilityConditions, Applicability, Transport, Γ_timePolicy, PlaneRegime, Audit⟩`  
and admits Realizations (kernel‑level or architheory‑level) that respect it. The shape is **notation‑independent** and **conceptual** (no tooling, storage, or CI metadata).

* **IntensionHeader.** `id` (PascalCase), `version` (SemVer), `status` (draft/review/stable/deprecated).  
  If realized as an **Architheory**, add the **A.6** header with `classification ∈ {CAL|LOG|CHR}` and `imports/provides`; **only CAL may export exactly one Γ**; **LOG/CHR export none**. For **Kernel‑level** realizations, do **not** mint an A.6 header.

* **Imports.** Architheory Signatures / `U.Types` this mechanism requires (notation‑independent; **acyclic**). When realized as an Architheory, **LOG/CHR may import CAL; CAL may import CAL** (A.6 layering).
* **BaseType.** A `U.Type` the mechanism ranges over. CHR spaces (e.g., a `U.CharacteristicSpace`/chart family) appear here **as types**; outside CHR, use set‑typed `U.Type`s. **Do not mint** a new core type; **reference existing `U.Type`s**. If planes differ, state the **ReferencePlane** policy (see *PlaneRegime*).
* **SubjectKind / SliceSet / ExtentRule / ResultKind? / ParamKinds.**
  • **SubjectKind.** The intensional kind acted upon (C.3.1/3.2), separate from quantification.
  • **SliceSet.** The addressable set of Context slices (USM: **ContextSliceSet**).
  • **ExtentRule.** A rule yielding `Extension(SubjectKind, slice)` (C.3.2), used as the quantifier’s domain.
  • **ResultKind?** Optional intensional kind for outputs of `OperatorAlgebra`.
  • **ParamKinds.** A name→Kind map for multi‑ary operators (inputs); avoids overloading “Role”.
* **OperatorAlgebra.** Named operations with types; examples:  
  • **USM:** `∈, ⊆, ∩, SpanUnion, translate, widen, narrow, refit`.  
  • **UNM:** `apply(method)`, `compose`, `quotient(≡_UNM)`; **normalize‑then‑compare**.

* **LawSet.** Equations/invariants (no proofs here). **Admissions/eligibility tests belong under AdmissibilityConditions, not here.** Laws **MUST** be compatible with CHR legality where numeric comparison/aggregation is induced. Examples:
  • **USM:** serial **intersection**; **SpanUnion** only where a **named independence assumption** is satisfied (state features/axes, validity window, evidence class); `translate` uses declared Bridges; **Γ_time** is mandatory.  
  • **UNM:** **scale‑appropriate** transforms — ratio→positive‑scalar; interval→affine; ordinal→monotone; nominal→categorical; `tabular:LUT(+uncertainty)`.  
  *(Do not mint a new Kernel token for “certificate”; if such a type is later required, it **MUST** follow DRR/LEX minting.)*

* **AdmissibilityConditions.** Deterministic, **context‑local** predicates that **fail closed** (e.g., “Scope covers TargetSlice” with named **Γ_time**; “NormalizationMethod class + validity window named”). Unknowns **→ {degrade | abstain}**; never coerce to 0/false.

* **Applicability.** Binding to a **`U.BoundedContext`** with stance/plane/time notes and any **CG‑Spec/MM‑CHR** legality claims; cross‑context use is declared via **Transport** only.

* **Transport.** **Bridge‑only** semantics for cross‑context / cross‑plane use: name the Bridge and channel (`Scope|Kind`) per **F.9**, and record **ReferencePlane**(src,tgt) per **C.2.1**. Do **not** restate CL ladders, **CL^plane**, or Φ/Ψ tables here; penalties **route to R/R_eff only** and **never** mutate F/G (per **B.3**). Crossings are explicit; **no implicit crossings**. Where **USM** or **KindBridge** are used together, apply the **two‑bridge rule** (scope CL and kind `CL^k` penalties handled **separately** to R).

* **Γ_timePolicy.** Point/window/policy; **no implicit “latest.”** Validity windows are **named**; **required** whenever guards reference time.
* **PlaneRegime.** Declare `ReferencePlane` on values/paths; when planes differ, name **CL^plane** and apply a **Φ_plane** policy (Part F/B.3). Plane penalties **do not** change CL; route to **R/R_eff** only; **F/G** stay invariant.

* **Audit.** Conceptual audit surface only (no data/telemetry workflows): crossings are publishable on **UTS**; surface **policy‑ids** rather than tables. Edition pins and regression hooks (if any) are referenced by id; operational details remain out of scope.
* **SignatureBlock alignment (A.6).** When realized as an **Architheory**, map `U.Mechanism.Intension` to the **A.6 Signature Block** — `Imports`, **Derivations**, **Invariants**, **BelongsToAssurance** — and include the **A.6 header** with `classification/provides`. **CAL** Realizations MAY **provide exactly one Γ**; **LOG/CHR provide none**; **imports form a DAG**; internals **opaque**.

**Compatibility with A.6.** If realized as an **architheory** (CAL/LOG/CHR), obey A.6 (**one Γ for CAL only; acyclic imports; opacity**). Kernel‑level realizations remain notation‑independent and publish the same fields for auditability. LEX discipline applies to all minted tokens.

#### 4.2 U.MechMorph · Refinement, Extension, Equivalence & Composition

**Intent.** Provide structure‑preserving **relations & constructors** between mechanisms.  
**Definitions.**

* **Refinement** `M′ ⊑ M`: narrows **SliceSet/ExtentRule** or **strengthens laws** (safe substitution; Liskov‑style).
* **Extension** `M ⊑⁺ M″`: **adds operations** without weakening existing Laws; old programs remain valid (conservative extension).
* **Equivalence** `M ≡ M′`: there exists a bijective mapping between Subjects/ops preserving/reflecting **LawSet** (up‑to‑isomorphism on **BaseType** and **OperatorAlgebra**).
    
* **Quotient** `M/≈`: factor by a **congruence** (e.g., **≡_UNM** for charts).

* **Product** `M×N`: independent **BaseTypes**; ops are component‑wise; ensures **no illegal cross‑ops** (e.g., set‑algebra discipline for `SpanUnion`). Where independence is claimed, **name and justify** the assumption (do not mint new Kernel types here).

**Transport** `Bridge⋅M`: lifts across Contexts/planes; names **CL/CL^k/CL^plane** regimes; penalties → **`R_eff` only**; **UTS row** recommended for publication; **ReferencePlane(src,tgt)** recorded. If mapping losses are material, **narrow** the mapped set or publish an **adapter** (best practice).

**Passing example.** `USM′ = USM + “publish named independence‑assumption evidence for SpanUnion”` ⇒ **Refinement** (strengthened law; substitution‑safe).
**Normalization quotient.** `UNM / ≡_UNM` exposes **compare‑on‑invariants** surfaces for UCPM/USCM (normalize‑then‑compare).

#### 4.3 U.MechAuthoring · Instantiation template

**MechanismDescription (E.8 Tell–Show–Show; I/D/S‑compliant):**
`Mechanism: U.<Name>`  *(Kernel conceptual description; no tooling fields)*
`Imports: <Signatures / U.Types>` · `SubjectBlock: <SubjectKind, BaseType, SliceSet, ExtentRule, ResultKind?>` · `ParamKinds: <name→Kind map>` · `OperatorAlgebra: <operators with types>` · `LawSet: <equations/invariants>` · `AdmissibilityConditions: <admission predicates; Γ_time>` · `Transport: <Bridge channels; CL/CL^k/CL^plane named; ReferencePlane(src,tgt)>` · `PlaneRegime: <world|concept|episteme rules>`

#### 4.4 MechFamilyDescription & MechInstanceDescription 

* **MechFamilyDescription**: `{Mechanism.Intension, Realizationα, Realizationβ, …}` — each Realization may **tighten** (never relax) Laws (Liskov‑style).

* **MechInstanceDescription**: `{Mechanism.Intension@Context, Windows, named Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane regimes, BridgeIds}` — a **conceptual instance**; operational telemetry/workflows are out of scope.

### 5 · Archetypal Grounding

#### 5.1 **U.System (Work) — USM as a U.Mechanism instance** (normative by reference)

* **Imports:** `U.ContextSliceSet`; Part F.9 **Bridge**; **C.2.1 ReferencePlane** (noted for crossings); **C.2.2 F–G–R**; **C.2.3 U.Formality**.
* **BaseType:** `U.ContextSliceSet`.
* **SliceSet:** `U.ContextSliceSet` (addressable `U.ContextSlice`s).
* **SubjectKind:** `U.Scope` with specializations `U.ClaimScope` (G) and `U.WorkScope`.
* **OperatorAlgebra:** `∈, ⊆, ∩, SpanUnion, translate, widen, narrow, refit`.
* **LawSet:** serial **intersection**; **SpanUnion** only where a **named independence assumption** is satisfied (state features/axes, validity window, evidence class); **translate** uses declared **Bridges**; **Γ_time** is **mandatory**.
* **AdmissibilityConditions:** deterministic **“Scope covers TargetSlice”**; **fail‑closed**; `unknown → {degrade|abstain}` (no implicit `unknown→0/false`).
* **Transport:** **Bridge‑only** with **CL**; penalties → **`R_eff`**; **F/G** invariant; publish UTS notes.
* **Γ_timePolicy:** `point | window | policy`; **no implicit “latest.”**
* **PlaneRegime:** *not applicable to scope sets* (scope is set‑valued over `ContextSlice`, no value‑plane); **CL^plane** N/A.

#### 5.2 **U.Episteme (Knowledge) — UNM as a U.Mechanism instance** (normative by reference)

* **Imports:** **A.17/A.18 (CSLC)**; **C.16 (MM‑CHR)**; `U.BoundedContext`; Part F.9 **Bridge**; **C.2.1 ReferencePlane**.
* **BaseType:** chart/`U.CharacteristicSpace` family in a CN‑frame (one `U.BoundedContext`).
* **SubjectKind:** **NormalizationMethod classes** with induced **≡_UNM** equivalence over charts.
* **OperatorAlgebra:** `apply(method)`, `compose`, `quotient(≡_UNM)`; **normalize‑then‑compare** (exposes compare‑on‑invariants surfaces to UCPM/USCM).
* **LawSet:** scale‑appropriate transforms — `ratio:scale / interval:affine / ordinal:monotone / nominal:categorical / tabular:LUT(+uncertainty)`; **validity windows** per edition.
* **AdmissibilityConditions:** `method ∈ declared class‑set` AND **validity window named**; **fail‑closed**; `unknown → {degrade|abstain}`.
* **Transport:** **Bridge‑only** on cross‑Context; when **describedEntity changes**, declare **KindBridge (CL^k)**; penalties → **`R_eff` only**.
* **Γ_timePolicy:** **named validity windows** for NormalizationMethod/instances (editioned).
* **PlaneRegime:** values live on **episteme ReferencePlane**; on plane crossings apply **CL^plane** policy; penalties → **`R_eff` only**.

*(No operational telemetry implied; publication remains conceptual.)*

### 6 · Defaults

* **Local‑first semantics.** All judgments are **context‑local**; crossings are **explicit** and **costed** (CL→R only).
* **Compliance‑first comparability.** Numeric comparison/aggregation requires **CG‑Spec** (lawful **SCP**, Γ‑fold, MinimalEvidence); **partial orders return sets**; **no ordinal means**.
* **Tri‑state discipline.** `unknown → {degrade|abstain}`; `sandbox/probe‑only` is a **LOG branch** with a policy‑id (no implicit `unknown→0/false`).
* **R‑only penalties.** **Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane** are **monotone and bounded**; penalties route to **`R_eff` only**; **F/G invariant**.

### 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑UM.1** | **Complete Mechanism.Intension** publishes: `Imports; SubjectBlock (SubjectKind, BaseType, SliceSet, ExtentRule, ResultKind?); ParamKinds; OperatorAlgebra; LawSet; AdmissibilityConditions; Applicability; Transport (Bridge named; ReferencePlane); Γ_timePolicy; PlaneRegime; Audit`. |
| **CC‑UM.2** | **A.6 alignment:** if realized as Architheory, use A.6 header; **one Γ only if CAL**; LOG/CHR none; **imports acyclic**; Realizations **opaque**; laws may be **tightened** (not relaxed). |
| **CC‑UM.3** | **Bridge‑only transport:** crossings **name** a **Bridge** (F.9); `ReferencePlane(src,tgt)` recorded (C.2.1); **CL^plane** named when planes differ; **no implicit crossings**. When typed reuse is involved, the **two‑bridge rule** applies (scope CL and kind `CL^k` penalties routed **separately** to **R**). |
| **CC‑UM.4** | **R‑only routing:** Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane regimes and CL ladders per **B.3**; penalties **reduce R/R_eff** only; **F/G invariant**. |
| **CC‑UM.5** | **CG‑Spec binding** for any numeric compare/aggregate: lawful **SCP** and Γ‑fold; **normalize‑then‑compare**; **partial orders return sets**; **no ordinal means**; interval/ratio arithmetic only with unit alignment (CSLC‑proven). |
| **CC‑UM.6** | **E.8/E.10 compliance:** Tell–Show–Show present under **“Archetypal Grounding”**; twin registers & I‑D‑S respected; any new `U.*` token requires a **DRR** and **LEX.TokenClass** entry; non‑spec surfaces end with **“…Description”**; **no tool/vendor tokens in Core**. |
| **CC‑UM.7** | **Unknowns tri‑state:** guards define `unknown → {degrade|abstain}`; sandbox/probe branches live in **SoS‑LOG** (not Acceptance).

### 8 · Born‑via‑A.6.1 sketches (informative)

**CPM — Unified Comparison Mechanism (parity‑grade orders)**  
**BaseType:** typed traits/charts in a CG‑Frame. **OperatorAlgebra:** lawful orders (≤, ≽, lexicographic) + **set‑returning** dominance (Pareto). **LawSet:** **no ordinal averaging**; **normalize‑then‑compare** when spaces/scales differ (UNM); editions pinned. **AdmissibilityConditions:** **CG‑Spec** bound; **ComparatorSet** explicit. **Transport:** Bridge+CL → **R/R_eff only**.  

**USCM — Unified Scoring Mechanism (SCP‑first)**  
**BaseType:** `U.Measure` (CHR‑typed slots). **OperatorAlgebra:** gauge embeddings + admissible aggregators; **WeightedSum** only on interval/ratio with unit alignment; partial orders return sets. **Guards:** **MinimalEvidence** \+ CG‑Spec legality. **Transport:** penalties → **R/R_eff**; UTS row.

**PTM — Publication & Telemetry Mechanism (informative)**
**BaseType:** `SoTA‑Pack(Core)`, `PathId/PathSliceId`, `PolicyId`. **OperatorAlgebra:** emit **selector‑ready** packs with parity pins and **telemetry stubs**; listen for edition/illumination bumps; trigger **slice‑scoped** refresh. 

**LawSet:** **no change of dominance defaults** unless CAL policy promotes; edition‑aware refresh. **Guards:** AH‑1..AH‑4 block missing pins. **Transport/Audit:** **G.10/G.11** publication & refresh semantics (CL routing to **R/R_eff**).

*Informative SoTA:* telemetry hooks align with post‑2015 quality‑diversity families (CMA‑ME/MAE, DQD/MEGA) and open‑ended methods (POET‑class) when gauged (illumination) rather than scored.

### **9 · SoTA-Echoing (post-2015 practice alignment)** *(informative)*

**Purpose.** To show how the FPF concept of a *Mechanism* (law-governed signature with guards and transport) aligns with, and improves upon, leading research and engineering practices after 2015.  
All comparisons are *informative*: they serve didactic continuity, not new normative force.

#### 9.1 Contemporary references (post-2015 sources)

1. **Algebraic effects and handlers** (Koka, Effekt, OCaml 5) — formalise “operation + lawful handler” semantics.
    
2. **Institution theory** (Goguen–Burstall; HETS evolutions) — defines translation between signatures, sentences, and models by typed morphisms.
    
3. **Policy-as-Code** (Rego/OPA, ISO 3450x ODD) — codifies admissibility and risk predicates for runtime enforcement.
    
4. **Session / Typestate types** (post-2017 multiparty protocols, linear usage) — constrain admissible operation sequences and states.
    
5. **Measurement-legality in machine learning** (2015 – 2025 monotone and calibrated learning, conformal prediction) — exemplifies the need for explicit scale compliance and monotonicity proofs (CSLC/CG-Spec echo).
    

Each source corresponds to a distinct *Tradition*: formal semantics, categorical algebra, compliance automation, protocol safety, and lawful AI.

#### 9.2 Alignment with A.6.1 fields and concepts

| External practice | Corresponding A.6.1 field / construct | FPF alignment and improvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algebraic effects & handlers | **OperatorAlgebra + LawSet** | FPF generalises effect signatures into universal operator laws; adds Γ_time for temporal legality and explicit R-routing. |
| Institution morphisms | **U.MechMorph** (Refine/Extend/Quotient) | Mechanism morphisms reuse institutional structure but add ContextSlice & Bridge discipline; CL penalties route → R_eff. |
| Policy-as-Code / ODD | **AdmissibilityConditions + Γ_timePolicy** | Policies become first-class lawful guards; FPF forbids hidden context or “latest” defaults. |
| Session / Typestate protocols | **AdmissibilityConditions + set-valued USM Scopes** | Deterministic guards preserve state safety; composable across Contexts by Bridges. |
| Lawful measurement (ML) | **CG-Spec / MM-CHR** binding | Enforces CSLC proofs; forbids ordinal averaging; guarantees unit/scale alignment. |

#### 9.3 Adopt / Adapt / Reject summary

* **Adopt** formal, law-governed signatures (Institutions + Effects); explicit admissibility predicates.
    
* **Adapt** runtime policy execution into *static AdmissibilityConditions + Γ_time* (no embedded evaluators).
    
* **Reject** tool-bound semantics, automatic recency heuristics, or any cross-scale arithmetic without CSLC proof.

#### 9.4 Holonic repeatability

The same correspondence holds at **every holonic level**:  
a part-holon declares its own `OperatorAlgebra/LawSet/AdmissibilityConditions`; a whole-holon merges them via Bridges; a meta-holon re-binds mechanisms under a new Γ-closure. All penalties remain in **R / R_eff**, while **F / G** invariants propagate intact.

### 10 · 60‑second didactic script 

> *“To mint a mechanism, fill a **Mechanism.Intension**: declare **SubjectBlock** (**SubjectKind**, **BaseType**, **SliceSet**, **ExtentRule**, **ResultKind?**) and **ParamKinds**; then **OperatorAlgebra/Laws/AdmissibilityConditions** and **Γ_time**; define **Transport** (Bridge/CL with penalties to R only), and **Audit** (UTS + Path pins). Realize it as CAL/LOG/CHR under **A.6**. USM and UNM are already such mechanisms; the same template births comparison, scoring, and publication mechanisms—safely bound to **CG‑Spec**—without leaving the kernel grammar.”*

### 11 · Quick “builder’s” checklist (author‑facing)

1. Draft **AT0/AT1 charter**: why this Mechanism, which **guard surfaces** and **comparability** are in scope; is a **Γ_m (CAL)** builder needed?
    
* Fill **Mechanism.Intension** (**SubjectBlock**, **ParamKinds**, **OperatorAlgebra**, **LawSet**, **AdmissibilityConditions**, **Applicability**, **Transport**, **Γ_timePolicy**, **PlaneRegime**, **Audit**).
    
* Bind **CHR legality & CG‑Spec** when comparing/aggregating (ComparatorSet, ScaleComplianceProfile (SCP), MinimalEvidence, Γ‑fold).
    
Ship **UTS + G.10**; wire **G.11** telemetry (PathSlice‑keyed); ensure penalties **route to `R_eff` only**.

### 12 · Consequences (informative)

* **Uniform kernel shape.** Scope, normalization, comparison families can be authored and compared without lexical drift.
* **Auditable reuse.** GateCrossings are UTS‑visible; penalties are transparent (**R only**), with **AH‑1..AH‑4** harness coverage.
* **Scalarisation avoids illegality.** Partial orders remain set‑valued; cross‑scale arithmetic is blocked by **CG‑Spec/CSLC**.

### 13 · Rationale (informative)

Anchoring mechanisms in **A.6 Signature→Realization** provides a minimal, typed surface that preserves **USM** set‑algebra and **UNM** “normalize‑then‑compare” quotients while making **Part F (Bridges)** crossings explicit and costed on **R** (never **F/G**).

### 14 · Relations (quick pointers)

Builds on **A.6**; instantiates **A.2.6 USM** (ContextSlice, Γ_time, ∩/SpanUnion/translate) and **A.19/C.16 UNM** (classes, ≡\_UNM, validity windows); uses **Part B** (Bridges, CL/CL^k/CL^plane; **no implicit crossings**); binds **CG‑Spec** for any numeric comparison/aggregation; telemetry/publication via **G.10/G.11**.

## A.6.2 · **`U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` — Effect‑free morphisms of epistemes** [A]

**One‑line summary.** `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (EFEM) is the universal class of **effect‑free, law‑governed morphisms between epistemes**. An EFEM morphism rewrites episteme components (ClaimGraph, `describedEntityRef`, optional `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, `referenceScheme`, and—where C.2.1+ is in use—`representationSchemeRef` and related slots, plus meta) in a **conservative, functorial, reproducible** way, with an explicit mode for what happens to the **DescribedEntitySlot** (`DescribedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}`) as defined by `C.2.1 U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.

**Status.** Normative [A] in **Part A (Kernel)**.

### 1 · Problem frame

FPF has many operations that **transform knowledge artifacts** without directly doing work in the world:

* turning an informal method description into a more formal specification;
* projecting a large system description into a smaller “for‑safety‑officer” view;
* re‑expressing the same behavioural model in a different calculus or notation;
* retargeting an analysis from “this subsystem” to “that subsystem” along a known KindBridge.

All of these are **episteme→episteme** transforms: they change what is written in an episteme, but they **do not themselves measure, execute, or actuate**. They are neither Work (A.15) nor Mechanisms in the A.6.1 sense; they are “pure morphisms over epistemes”.

Without a universal pattern for such morphisms:

* every family (KD‑CAL, E.TGA, MVPK, discipline packs) reinvent their own notion of “projection”, “reinterpretation”, or “refinement”;
* laws about what may change in an episteme (content vs described entity vs grounding holon vs reference plane) fragment across the spec;
* cross‑family reasoning (e.g. “this E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation is a retargeting, not a view”) becomes brittle and ad‑hoc.

### 2 · Problem

Concretely, without EFEM:

1. **No single place for “effect‑free” discipline.**
   The distinction *“episteme‑only change”* vs *“Work in the world”* is already important (C.2.1 separates episteme components from Work and from presentation surfaces), but the laws for “episteme‑only” operations are scattered or implicit. 

2. **Described entity behaviour is unclear.**
   Many transforms **intend** to keep “what this episteme is about” fixed (viewing), others **intend** to change it under an invariant (retargeting). Without a common *DescribedEntityChangeMode* discipline we get silent breaks in “describedEntity”: an operation that looks like a harmless format change may in fact surreptitiously change the entity‑of‑interest.

3. **No functorial backbone.**
   MVPK, KD‑CAL and E.TGA all implicitly assume that episteme transforms **compose** and respect identities, but the conditions for this (purity, conservativity, idempotence, scope) are not formulated once and reused. Different parts of the spec repeat subtly different sets of laws.

4. **Slot/Ref confusion.**
   With the new `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` and `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`, every episteme now has explicit **SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind** discipline. Laws for “projection” or “retargeting” that are written against “fields” or unnamed tuple components are now out of alignment.

The result: engineers and tool builders can no longer tell **when they are allowed to transform epistemes without changing what is being claimed about the world**, nor what needs to be witnessed by Bridges and CL‑penalties when describedEntity does change.

### 3 · Forces

* **Epistemic purity vs operational power.**
  Effect‑free episteme transforms are attractive precisely because they can be reasoned about algebraically and composed freely. But the more operational power they are given (IO, solver calls, measurements), the less they remain “pure” and the more they belong under `U.Mechanism` / `U.WorkEnactment`.

* **Preserve vs retarget.**
  Viewing is describedEntity‑preserving; reinterpretation along a KindBridge is describedEntity‑retargenting. Both are important, but **they must be distinguished and witnessed differently**.

* **Conservativity vs usefulness.**
  EFEM should be **conservative**: no new intensional commitments beyond what input epistemes already entail. At the same time, we need transformations that can *factor*, *aggregate*, or *normalise* content, which may drop some information or change its representation.

* **Locality vs reference planes and Bridges.**
  Epistemes live on **reference planes** (C.2.1); cross‑plane and cross‑Context reasoning goes via Bridges and CL penalties (Part F/B.3). EFEM must respect this: it cannot smuggle plane changes or transport into “pure” content rewrites.

* **I/D/S strict distinction.**
  Intension (`I`) is not itself an episteme; `…Description` and `…Spec` are epistemes with a `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`. EFEM must support operations on D/S epistemes while keeping the I/D/S layering intact (A.7, E.10.D2).

### 4 · Solution — define `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` once

#### 4.1 · Informal definition

> **Definition.** A `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (EFEM) is a class of **episteme→episteme morphisms** that:
>
> * operate **only** on the components of an episteme as fixed in `C.2.1 U.EpistemeSlotGraph` (ClaimGraph, slots for described entity, grounding holon, viewpoint, representation/reference schemes, meta); 
> * are **effect‑free** (no Work, no Mechanism application, no mutation of systems or carriers);
> * are **conservative** in what they claim about the described entity (no new intensional commitments beyond logical consequences under the declared ReferenceScheme);
> * are **functorial** (identities and composition behave as expected on the category of epistemes);
> * declare an explicit **DescribedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}**, controlling how `DescribedEntitySlot` (and associated subjectRef) behaves.

The **objects** of the EFEM universe are epistemes of some `U.EpistemeKind` (typically realised as `U.EpistemeCard` / `U.EpistemeView` / `U.EpistemePublication`). The **arrows** are EFEM morphisms `f : X → Y` satisfying the P0–P5 laws below.

Specialisations:

* `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) — EFEM with `DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve`.
* `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (A.6.4) — EFEM with `DescribedEntityChangeMode = retarget`, tied to KindBridges/ReferencePlanes.

#### 4.2 · Signature Block (A.6.0 alignment)

As a `U.Signature`, EFEM publishes the following **SubjectBlock** and the standard four‑row block (“SubjectBlock / Vocabulary / Laws / Applicability”) from A.6.0, specialised to episteme→episteme morphisms.

**SubjectBlock**

```
SubjectBlock
  SubjectKind   = U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing
  BaseType      = ⟨X : U.Episteme, Y : U.Episteme⟩        // carrier pair (domain,codomain)
  Quantification= SliceSet:=U.ContextSliceSet; 
  ExtentRule:=admissibleEpistemeMorphisms // Context slices & admissible EFEM per slice
  ResultKind?   = U.Morphism                               // typed morphism f : X→Y
```

This says: EFEM is “about” **morphisms between epistemes**, indexed by Context slices; its results are morphisms of a declared type `U.Morphism` in the `Ep` category.

**Vocabulary (core operators & kinds)**

* **Types**
  * `U.Episteme` (as holon; realised via species `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, `U.EpistemePublication` under C.2.1).
  * `U.EpistemeKind` (episteme n‑ary relation signature; slots per A.6.5 / C.2.1).
  * `U.SubjectRef` (subject reference; for D/S epistemes this is `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` per IDS‑13 (DescriptionContext discipline; C.2.1 §6.1 / E.10.D2)).
  * `U.Morphism` (arrow in `Ep`).
  * `U.DescribedEntityChangeMode = {preserve, retarget}` (enumeration; no new Kernel type for “DescribedEntity”).

* **Operators (arrow algebra)**

  * `id_X : U.Morphism(X→X)` for any episteme `X`.
  * `compose(g,f) : U.Morphism(X→Z)` where `f : X→Y`, `g : Y→Z`.
  * `apply(f, x:U.Episteme) : U.Episteme`.
  * `dom(f), cod(f) : U.Episteme`.
  * `subjectRef(E) : U.SubjectRef`.
  * `describedEntityChangeMode(f) : U.DescribedEntityChangeMode`  // EFEM‑level characteristic from C.2.1.

Each operator that takes epistemes as arguments obeys **SlotSpec discipline** from A.6.5: in particular, laws below are phrased in terms of the **named SlotKinds** (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, `ViewSlot`, and—when the C.2.1+ extension is used—`RepresentationSchemeSlot`) and their associated ValueKind/RefKind; we never speak of “field 1/2/3”.

**Laws row** and **Applicability** are given by P0–P5 and the Scope clause below.

#### 4.3 · Laws P0–P5 (normative)

All laws below are **normative**: any morphism advertised as an instance of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` SHALL satisfy them.

##### P0 — Typed signature & component profile (C.2.1‑grounded)

For any EFEM morphism `f : X→Y`:

1. **Typed objects.** `X` and `Y` are epistemes of declared kinds `K_X, K_Y : U.EpistemeKind`, each with a SlotKind signature as per C.2.1 and A.6.5 (at least `DescribedEntitySlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot?`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot?`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot?`; `GroundingHolonSlot?`, `ViewSlot?` where relevant).

2. **Component projection.** For each episteme `E`, EFEM laws may refer to:
   * `content(E) : U.ClaimGraph` — value of `ClaimGraphSlot` (stored **by value** in the minimal core);
   * `describedEntityRef(E) : U.EntityRef` — value of the RefKind for `DescribedEntitySlot`;
   * `groundingHolonRef?(E) : U.HolonRef` — if the episteme kind includes `GroundingHolonSlot`;
   * `viewpointRef?(E) : U.ViewpointRef` — if `ViewpointSlot` is present;
   * `referenceScheme?(E) : U.ReferenceScheme` — value of `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (stored **by value** in the minimal core);
   * `representationSchemeRef?(E) : U.RepresentationSchemeRef` — only for episteme kinds that use the C.2.1+ `RepresentationSchemeSlot`;
   * `meta(E)` — edition/provenance/status components (species‑level).

3. **Declared `DescribedEntityChangeMode`.**
   Each EFEM species **declares** a fixed `DescribedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}`. At the level of individual morphisms:

   * if `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = preserve`, then `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)` (and usually `groundingHolonRef(Y) = groundingHolonRef(X)` unless an explicit Grounding Bridge is declared);
   * if `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = retarget`, then `describedEntityRef(Y) ≠ describedEntityRef(X)` in general and a **KindBridge** between the two described entities MUST be named (A.6.4 / F.9).

4. **SubjectRef compatibility.**
   For D/S epistemes (`…Description` / `…Spec`), `subjectRef(E)` is a `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` (E.10.D2). EFEM species SHALL state how `subjectRef` transforms in terms of these components (usually: preserve or explicitly adjust `ViewpointRef` while preserving `DescribedEntityRef` and `BoundedContextRef`).

##### P1 — Purity (no external effects)

EFEM morphisms are **pure functions on epistemes**:
* Applying `f : X→Y` **does not**:
  * change any `U.System` or `U.Holon` state;
  * execute Work (`U.WorkEnactment`) or run a `U.Mechanism` (A.6.1) with operational guards;
  * mutate `U.PresentationCarrier` (files, databases, message buses, IDEs).
* The **only** state change introduced by EFEM is the replacement of input epistemes by output epistemes according to `apply(f, X) = Y`, with all component changes governed by P2–P5.

Any operation that requires **measurements, simulations, solver calls, or tool use with external side‑effects** SHALL be modelled as a `U.Mechanism`/`U.Work` that **produces new epistemes**, which may then be related by EFEM morphisms.

##### P2 — Conservativity (no new intensional commitments)

Let `content_X = content(X)`, `content_Y = content(Y)`, with associated `referenceScheme_X`, `referenceScheme_Y`, `describedEntityRef_X`, `describedEntityRef_Y`, `groundingHolonRef_X`, `groundingHolonRef_Y`. Interpret each `content` via its `ReferenceScheme` and slots. Then:

> The set of **claims about the described entities** that can be read from `Y` **SHALL NOT introduce new atomic commitments** beyond those that are logical consequences of the claims read from `X`, possibly after applying a declared correspondence between representation/reference schemes.

Intuitively:

* EFEM may:
  * delete information (projection/abstraction);
  * normalise or re‑express information (e.g., reordering ClaimGraph, changing notation via a ReferenceScheme/RepresentationScheme correspondence);
  * add **meta‑claims about the episteme** itself (edition, source, status, witness entries).

* EFEM may **not**:
  * assert new atomic facts about the described entities or grounding holons beyond what is derivable from input ClaimGraphs under the declared ReferenceSchemes;
  * silently widen the scope of claims (e.g., treating local facts as global, changing Context or ReferencePlane without a Bridge).

Where `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = retarget`, conservativity is understood **relative to a declared invariant** of the KindBridge (A.6.4): e.g., conservation of energy for a Fourier transform, or preservation of functional behaviour for a structural reinterpretation.

##### P3 — Functoriality (identity, composition, correspondence)

We work in the category **Ep** whose objects are epistemes (species of `U.Episteme`) and whose arrows are EFEM morphisms satisfying P0–P2, together with the functor

```
+α : Ep → Ref
```

that maps each episteme to the object it describes (value of `DescribedEntitySlot`, i.e. `describedEntityRef(E)`) as in the mathematical layer for epistemes. EFEM instances with `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = preserve` are **vertical morphisms** for α (`α(f) = id`), while those with `describedEntityChangeMode(f) = retarget` reindex along a declared `KindBridge` in **Ref**.

1. **Identities.** For each episteme `X`, there exists `id_X : X→X` such that:

   ```text
   apply(id_X, X) = X
   compose(id_Y, f) = f = compose(f, id_X)
   ```

   `id_X` preserves all components (`content`, `describedEntityRef`, `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, `representationSchemeRef`, `referenceScheme`, `meta`).

2. **Composition.** For `f : X→Y`, `g : Y→Z`, the composite `h = compose(g,f)` is an EFEM morphism `X→Z` with:

   ```
   apply(h, X) = apply(g, apply(f, X))
   describedEntityChangeMode(h) = combine(describedEntityChangeMode(f), describedEntityChangeMode(g))   // as per species-specific rules
   ```

and P0–P2 hold for `h`. For example, two `preserve` morphisms compose to `preserve`; `preserve` after `retarget` is `retarget` if the KindBridge composition exists.

3. **Correspondence‑aware composition.**
   When EFEM changes `RepresentationScheme` or `ReferenceScheme`, a **CorrespondenceModel** (as in C.2.1 §6 and E.17) may be needed to witness commutativity: composition MUST respect these correspondences up to declared isomorphism/oplax naturality (witness epistemes may be recorded in `meta`).

##### P4 — Idempotence & determinism (on fixed configuration)

For any EFEM morphism `f : X→Y` with fixed configuration (episteme kinds, `DescribedEntityChangeMode` characteristic, KindBridge/CorrespondenceModel where needed):

1. **Determinism.**
   For the same input episteme `X` (identical content, slots, meta), `apply(f, X)` yields the same output episteme `Y` up to declared structural equivalence (normal forms, alpha‑renaming etc.). There is no dependence on ambient time, randomness, network state, or solver heuristics unless these are **encoded as explicit inputs**.

2. **Idempotence (up to declared equivalence).**
   Re‑applying the same EFEM to its own output yields no further essential change:

   ```text
   apply(f, apply(f, X)) ≅ apply(f, X)
   ```

   where `≅` denotes the structural equivalence declared for the episteme kinds in question (e.g., ClaimGraph normalisation).

Species MAY weaken idempotence to “idempotent after normalisation”; if so, the normalisation step MUST itself be specified as an EFEM morphism and the composite be idempotent.

##### P5 — Applicability, scope & compatibility

Each EFEM species **publishes** an Applicability clause:

* **EoI / described entity class.**
  A constraint on the allowed ValueKind of `DescribedEntitySlot` (via `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity`): e.g., “epistemes describing `U.Holon` that are systems of type X”.

* **Grounding holon & Context.**
  Constraints on `GroundingHolonSlot` and `U.BoundedContext`: where the morphism is valid (lab, runtime environment, organisational context).

* **Representation/ReferenceSchemes.**
  Enumerates supported `RepresentationScheme`/`ReferenceScheme` pairs and any required CorrespondenceModels.

* **Viewpoint discipline.**
  For Descr/Spec epistemes, EFEM SHALL specify which `U.Viewpoint`s (E.17.0) it supports and how it interacts with `U.MultiViewDescribing` families (e.g., “works only on engineering viewpoints from TEVB” or “viewpoint‑agnostic normalisation”).

Applying EFEM **outside** its Applicability (e.g., wrong EoIClass, missing grounding holon, incompatible Viewpoint) is **non‑conformant**: a conformant implementation MUST reject such attempts or model them as different mechanisms/works, not as EFEM.

Cross‑Context or cross‑plane use (changing `U.BoundedContext` or `ReferencePlane`) is **not part of EFEM**; it is handled by Bridges (Part F) and A.6.1 transport, which then feed new epistemes into EFEM.

### 5 · Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

The examples below show how EFEM is intended to be used across I/D/S and Viewpoint/MVPK layers.

#### 5.1 · Typed formalisation `Specify_DS : D→S` (species of EFEM)

*Context.* You have an informal `U.MethodDescription` for a safety check and want a more formal `U.MethodSpec` with test harness obligations, but **about the same method**.

*Shape.*

* Domain: `X = U.MethodDescription` episteme with
  `describedEntityRef(X) : U.MethodRef`, `content(X) : U.ClaimGraph_D`, `viewpointRef(X)` an engineering viewpoint (TEVB), `ReferenceScheme_D`.
* Codomain: `Y = U.MethodSpec` episteme with the **same** `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)`, `viewpointRef(Y) = viewpointRef(X)`, more structured `content(Y) : U.ClaimGraph_S`, stronger ReferenceScheme (explicit pre/post, obligations).

`Specify_DS` is a species of EFEM:

* `describedEntityChangeMode(Specify_DS) = preserve`.
* P1 — effect‑free: it transforms epistemes only.
* P2 — conservative: any behavioural claims in the Spec must be logically entailed by the informal Description and the underlying Method Intension; if the spec makes stronger claims, that is modelled as creating a **new Intension with its own D/S pair**, not as a valid EFEM instance.
* P3–P5 — functorial and scoped: specs compose, applicability bound to the appropriate engineering context and Viewpoints.

This matches A.7/E.10.D2 strict distinction: I→D (`Describe_ID`) is not itself an episteme→episteme morphism, but `Specify_DS` is; EFEM supplies its laws.

#### 5.2 · Internal normalisation of a View (species of EFEM, `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`)

*Context.* In MVPK you compute a engineering view `V` of a system description; you then normalise the view (sort, factor, put equations into normal form) without changing what it says.

Let `X = V_raw`, `Y = V_norm`, both `U.EpistemeView` instances with the same:

* `describedEntityRef(X) = describedEntityRef(Y)` (same system);
* `groundingHolonRef(X) = groundingHolonRef(Y)` (same environment);
* `viewpointRef(X) = viewpointRef(Y)` (same Viewpoint);
* `representationSchemeRef(X) = representationSchemeRef(Y)` (same notation).

The EFEM `NormalizeView : X→Y`:

* has `describedEntityChangeMode(NormalizeView) = preserve`;
* changes only `content` and maybe `meta` (e.g. “normalised at edition E”);
* is idempotent and deterministic (P4);
* is conservative (P2): no new claims, only re‑expression.

MVPK can then **assume** functoriality of such normalisations without re‑stating the EFEM laws.

#### 5.3 · Retargeting sketch (bridge‑backed, `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`)

*Context.* E.TGA’s StructuralReinterpretation maps a physical layout view into a functional behaviour view, changing the described entity from “physical module assembly” to “functional graph” along a KindBridge.

Inside EFEM, this becomes a species with `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`:
* input episteme describes `S₁` (e.g. a component hierarchy holon);
* output episteme describes `S₂` (e.g. a functional network holon);
* a declared `KindBridge(S₁,S₂)` and invariant (e.g. behavioural equivalence) provide the semantic glue;
* P2 conservativity is checked **w.r.t. that invariant**.

The details belong to A.6.4/E.TGA; EFEM provides the generic discipline.

#### 5.4 · Worked SlotSpec example (engineering SystemDescription episteme kind)
*(informative)*

To make the SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline and EFEM laws concrete, consider a simple engineering `U.EpistemeKind` for system descriptions over `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` with `EoIClass = U.System` in a given Context. A minimal SlotSpec table for such a kind could be:

| SlotKind              | ValueKind                                     | RefKind / refMode   | Notes                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DescribedEntitySlot` | `U.Entity` (constrained by `EoIClass = U.System`) | `U.EntityRef`    | describes which system the episteme is about                          |
| `GroundingHolonSlot`  | `U.Holon`                                     | `U.HolonRef`        | plant / runtime SoS grounding measurements and validation             |
| `ClaimGraphSlot`      | `U.ClaimGraph`                                | ByValue             | KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL ClaimGraph for the description or spec                 |
| `ViewpointSlot`       | `U.Viewpoint`                                 | `U.ViewpointRef`    | engineering viewpoint (e.g. from TEVB) under which D/S are validated |
| `ReferenceSchemeSlot` | `U.ReferenceScheme`                           | ByValue             | how the ClaimGraph is read against described entity and grounding     |

This table is an instance of A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`: each row is a SlotSpec triple ⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode/RefKind⟩; no additional kernel types are introduced, and C.2.1’s constraints on `DescribedEntitySlot`/`GroundingHolonSlot` are preserved.

Two typical EFEM species over this kind are:
* `Specify_DS_Sys : SystemDescription → SystemSpec` — a `DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve` species that:
  * **reads** `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot` and **writes** a refined `ClaimGraphSlot` and possibly a strengthened `ReferenceSchemeSlot`;
  * satisfies P2 by only adding claims that are logical consequences of the original description plus the fixed Intension (A.7/E.10.D2);
  * satisfies CC‑C.2.1‑5 by explicitly declaring its slot profile and change mode.

* `Normalize_EngView : EpistemeView → EpistemeView` — a view‑normalisation EFEM (again with `DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve`) that:
  * **reads** all slots and **writes** only `ClaimGraphSlot` (normal form) and `meta`;
  * is idempotent and deterministic (P4) and pure (P1);
  * is conservative (P2) by construction: it never introduces new atoms about the described system.

In later A.6.3/A.6.4/E.17.* patterns, concrete EpistemeKinds (for specific engineering description/specification idioms) are expected to provide SlotSpecs of this general shape and to state explicitly, per CC‑C.2.1‑5 / CC‑EFEM.*, which slots their EFEM species read and write.

### 6 · Bias & Defaults (informative)

* **Episteme‑first, world‑second.** EFEM is strictly about **epistemes as objects**; any world contact (measurements, executions) lives in `U.Mechanism`/`U.Work` and produces new epistemes that EFEM may subsequently relate.

* **SlotKinds, not “fields”.** Laws talk about `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, etc., and their ValueKind/RefKind, as per A.6.5 and C.2.1; they never use unnamed tuple positions or “role 1/2/3”. This keeps EFEM aligned with the slot discipline used for methods, roles, services, and other n‑ary relations.

* **Local‑first semantics.** EFEM is **Context‑local**; crossings of Context or ReferencePlane are always delegated to Bridges / A.6.1 transport (with CL penalties to `R/R_eff` only). No “implicit cross‑Context EFEM” is permitted.

* **I/D/S respect.** EFEM never collapses Intension with Description/Spec: I→D and D→S operations are typed explicitly and either (i) conform to EFEM laws where they are episteme→episteme, or (ii) remain separate morphism classes (A.7) while being described as EFEM‑conformant.

### 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID                                                  | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

For every instance `f`, `describedEntityChangeMode(f)` MUST be either `preserve` (⇒ `describedEntityRef` unchanged) or `retarget` (⇒ a KindBridge and invariant are explicitly named; see A.6.4 / F.9).                                                                                         |
| **CC‑EFEM.3 (Purity).**                             | EFEM morphisms SHALL be effect‑free: they MUST NOT directly perform Work or run mechanisms with operational guards; they only read input epistemes and construct output epistemes consistent with P2–P5.

| **CC‑EFEM.5 (Functoriality & idempotence).**        | EFEM species SHALL support identity and composition with the usual category laws, and SHALL specify any structural equivalence under which idempotence holds.

| **CC‑EFEM.8 (Slot‑level read/write declaration).**  | Any EFEM species that defines morphisms between epistemes SHALL also satisfy C.2.1 checkpoint CC‑C.2.1‑5: it MUST state whether it is a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`/`U.EpistemicViewing`/`U.EpistemicRetargeting`, declare its `describedEntityChangeMode`, name which SlotKinds it reads and writes, and state its behaviour on `describedEntityRef`, `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, and `referenceScheme`. |

### 8 · SoTA‑Echoing (informative, lineage)

EFEM is intentionally “thin”: it provides a **minimal categorical and slot‑based discipline** for episteme→episteme morphisms, making it easy to align with several post‑2015 lines of work:

* **Categorical semantics & displayed categories.**
  Treating `Ep` as a category over `Ref` via a functor `α : Ep → Ref` (mapping each episteme to its described entity) matches the *displayed categories* view on fibrations: EFEM arrows are those morphisms in `Ep` that are “vertical” (preserve α) or “structured reindexings” (retarget under a KindBridge). This is exactly the intended alignment with C.2.1’s subjectRef/ReferencePlane picture.

* **Optics as universal projections.**
  Viewing operations (`U.EpistemicViewing`) refine EFEM in a way analogous to **lenses/prisms/traversals** in the optics literature: effect‑free, compositional accessors for parts of a larger structure. EFEM captures the laws that underlie those projections (purity, conservation, functoriality); optics‑style constructions can then be used inside discipline packs without modifying the core.

* **Structured cospans & correspondences.**
  Many correspondence‑based multi‑view patterns (ISO 42010 correspondences, model synchronisation, traceability links) can be seen as spans/cospans between epistemes. EFEM ensures that the legs of such cospans are effect‑free and conservative, while CorrespondenceModels carry the extra structure needed for consistency management.

* **Bidirectional transformations (BX).**
  The “no new commitments” and “functorial & idempotent” constraints mirror modern BX practice around **consistency restoration**: EFEM is the universal core that BX‑like constructions (view updates, synchronisers) must respect when instantiated for epistemes.

EFEM does *not* prescribe a specific calculus (deductive, probabilistic, latent‑space), nor a specific representation (symbolic vs distributed); those choices are captured in `U.ClaimGraph`, `U.RepresentationScheme` and discipline‑level architheories. EFEM only says what it means to transform epistemes **legally** in that chosen substrate.

### 9 · Consequences

* **Single place for episteme‑to‑episteme laws.**
  All effect‑free transforms of knowledge artefacts, across KD‑CAL, MVPK, E.TGA, discipline packs, can now be defined as species of EFEM, instead of each family re‑inventing its own law set.

* **Clear separation from mechanisms & work.**
  Anything that touches the world (measurements, execution, simulation) is forced into `U.Mechanism` / `U.WorkEnactment`, with CL‑penalised Bridges and Γ_time; EFEM remains pure and compositional.

* **Stable backbone for Viewing & Retargeting.**
  A.6.3 and A.6.4 do not need to repeat P0–P5; they specialise EFEM with additional constraints (preserve/retarget). Other patterns (e.g. MultiViewDescribing, MVPK, E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation) can depend on EFEM as a stable base.

* **Slot‑level clarity.**
  By formulating EFEM laws in terms of SlotKinds/ValueKinds/RefKinds (A.6.5) and the EpistemeSlotGraph (C.2.1), it becomes much harder for Episteme to confuse “object of talk”, “slot in a relation”, and “reference to that object”.

* **Better didactics.**
  The old “semantic triangle” becomes a didactic projection of EFEM over the EpistemeSlotGraph: EFEM + C.2.1 explain precisely what the triangle was trying to gesture at (symbol, concept, object), while correctly foregrounding operations, viewpoints, grounding holons, and reference schemes.

### 10 · Rationale

**Why a separate EFEM pattern (A.6.2) instead of folding into A.6.1 or C.2.1?**

* A.6.1 governs **Mechanisms** (operations with AdmissibilityConditions, Γ_time, transport and Bridges)—too operational for the pure episteme transforms we want here.
* C.2.1 fixes the **ontology of epistemes** (slots, components, ReferencePlane), but does not talk about morphisms. EFEM is explicitly a **morphism‑level** pattern over that ontology.

This split mirrors how Signature (A.6.0) separates “what is declared” from “how it is realised”: C.2.1 says what an episteme is; A.6.2 says what a legal episteme→episteme transform is.

**Why insist on DescribedEntityChangeMode?**

Because almost all subtle errors in multi‑view reasoning show up as **silent retargeting**: a transform that appears to keep the same object‑of‑talk actually changes it (e.g., from “component assembly” to “function bundle”) without naming the bridge or invariant. By forcing every species to declare `preserve` vs `retarget`, EFEM makes those decisions explicit and reviewable.

**Why attach EFEM to SlotKinds instead of informal “fields”?**

FPF already committed to a single SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline (A.6.5) across relations, methods, roles, and now epistemes. Re‑using that discipline here:

* aligns episteme morphisms with the rest of the framework;
* enables later mechanised checks (e.g., that a viewing only touches slots it promised to touch);
* avoids minting yet another notion of “parameter” or “role in a relation”.

### 11 · Relations

* **Specialises / is specialised by.**

  * Builds on A.6.0 `U.Signature` and A.6.1 `U.Mechanism` for the uniform SubjectBlock/vocabulary/laws/applicability structure.
  * Specialised by A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing` (describedEntity‑preserving EFEM) and A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (describedEntity‑retargering EFEM).

* **Constrained by.**
  A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` (SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind); C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` (episteme components, ReferencePlane); E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline); Part F (Bridges, CL, ReferencePlane crossings); E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE naming rules, especially on `…Slot` / `…Ref` and ban on Subject/Object in episteme tech names).

* **Consumed by.**
  E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing` (families of D/S epistemes under Viewpoints); E.17 (MVPK — publication as species of Viewing/EFEM); E.18 (E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation and other transductions over epistemes); KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL rules that reason about episteme transforms categorically.


---

## A.6.3 · **`U.EpistemicViewing` — describedEntity‑preserving morphism** \[A]

**One‑line summary.** `U.EpistemicViewing` is the **describedEntity‑preserving** species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`: an effect‑free projection between epistemes that may change content and representation, but **never changes what the episteme is about** (the occupant of `DescribedEntitySlot` in C.2.1).

**Status.** Normative [A] in **Part A (Kernel)**.
**Placement.** After **A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`**, before **A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting`**.

**Builds on.**
A.6.0 `U.Signature`; A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`; A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`; A.7/E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline, `DescriptionContext`); C.2.1 `U.Episteme — Epistemes and their slot graph`; C.2 (KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL, `subjectRef`, ReferencePlane).

**Used by.**
E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`; E.17 (MVPK — Multi‑View Publication Kit); E.17.1/E.17.2 (Viewpoint bundle libraries, TEVB); B.5.3 (Role‑EpistemicViewing); discipline packs for architecture, safety, and ML/LLM‑based representations.

### 1 · Problem frame

Engineers and researchers constantly need **views of the same knowledge artefact**:
* an ISO 42010‑style architectural view for a particular stakeholder group over a shared architecture description;
* a SysML v2 “view‑as‑query” over an underlying model, changing visualisation but not the modelled system;
* a publication view (Plain/Tech/Assurance) in MVPK over a common description/specification;
* an LLM‑friendly episteme derived from a symbolic specification (or vice versa), preserving what system is being described.

All of these are **episteme→episteme** transforms which intend to:
* keep the **DescribedEntity** fixed (`DescribedEntitySlot` in C.2.1), and
* change only **how** the episteme talks about it: sliced `U.ClaimGraph`, different `U.Viewpoint`, alternative `U.RepresentationScheme`, or a different `U.ReferenceScheme` tuned to the same entity and grounding holon.

We need a single, reusable notion of **“epistemic viewing”** that captures these projections as:
* **effect‑free** (no Work/Mechanism side‑effects),
* **describedEntity‑preserving** (no silent retargeting),
* **conservative** (no new intensional commitments about the same entity),
* and **functorial** (compose cleanly in multi‑step pipelines).

### 2 · Problem

Without a dedicated pattern for EpistemicViewing:
1. **Views vs retargetings blur.**
   Operations that *intend* to change only representation (viewing) are easily conflated with operations that change the **object‑of‑talk** (retargeting). A Fourier‑style transform or a StructuralReinterpretation in E.TGA can quietly drift from “view of S” into “view of a different S′”, without declaring a `KindBridge`.

2. **“View” vs “viewpoint” vs “surface” collapse.**
   In standards and tools, “view” is often used interchangeably to mean:
   * the **viewpoint** (specification of concerns and conformance rules),
   * the **episteme** produced under that viewpoint, and
   * the **surface** (rendered document or GUI).
     Without a clear episteme‑level notion of viewing, MVPK and E.17.0 cannot cleanly separate these layers.

2. **No describedEntity guarantees.**
   A projection that looks like a harmless slice of a system description may in fact:
   * change `describedEntityRef` (switching to a subsystem or a function),
   * change `groundingHolonRef` (different plant or runtime),
   * or smuggle in new intensional claims.
     Without explicit laws on C.2.1 components, “view” becomes an informal metaphor, not a reliable morphism class.

4. **Multi‑view reasoning has no core discipline.**
   Multi‑view patterns (ISO 42010 viewpoint libraries, SysML v2 view queries, TEVB, MVPK faces) need:
   * **vertical** projections over the same described entity (`α : Ep → Ref` fixed),
   * and **correspondence‑based** projections that rely on explicit cross‑episteme links.
     If each family re‑invents its own notion of “view”, consistency and tool support degrade.

### 3 · Forces

* **Same entity, different concerns.**
  Stakeholders want different slices of the same description/specification, sometimes under different viewpoints, without re‑identifying the entity (system, method, role, service) being described.

* **Internal vs cross‑episteme views.**
  Some views depend only on a single episteme (direct viewing); others depend on a **CorrespondenceModel** (e.g. aligning requirements and design models). Both must be supported, but with **different obligations**.

* **Conservativity vs expressivity.**
  A view must not introduce new commitments about the described entity, but it may:

  * aggregate or factor claims,
  * change representation regime (diagrammatic vs symbolic vs latent),
  * or shift to a different inference regime, **as long as this is conservative**.

* **I/D/S strictness.**
  `…Description` and `…Spec` are epistemes with `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`. Viewing must work over these **DescriptionContexts** without collapsing Intension (`I`) into episteme or confusing D/S with publication surfaces.

* **Slot discipline and modularity.**
  With C.2.1 and A.6.5, epistemes now have explicit `SlotKind`/`ValueKind`/`RefKind` triples. Viewing laws must be stated **at the slot level**, not in terms of ad‑hoc “fields”, so they can be reused across engineering, publication, and discipline packs.

### 4 · Solution — `U.EpistemicViewing` as EFEM profile (`describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`)

#### 4.1 · Informal definition

> **Definition (informal).**
> `U.EpistemicViewing` is the **describedEntity‑preserving species** of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`.
> A `U.EpistemicViewing v : X→Y`:
>
> * takes an input episteme `X` and produces an output episteme `Y`,
> * preserves the occupant of `DescribedEntitySlot` (`describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)`),
> * may refine or re‑express `content : U.ClaimGraph`, `viewpointRef`, `representationSchemeRef`, and `referenceScheme`,
> * is **effect‑free and conservative** (no new intensional claims about the same described entity),
> * and composes functorially with other epistemic viewings.

In C.2.1 terms `U.EpistemicViewing` behaves like a **lens/optic over the episteme slot graph**: it focuses on some SlotKinds (typically `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) while preserving `DescribedEntitySlot` (and usually `GroundingHolonSlot`).

#### 4.2 · Signature (A.6.0 / A.6.5 alignment)

**Signature header.**
`U.EpistemicViewing` is a **Morphism‑kind** under A.6.0:

```
SubjectBlock
  SubjectKind    = U.EpistemicViewing
  BaseType       = ⟨X:U.Episteme, Y:U.Episteme⟩      // carrier pair
  Quantification = SliceSet := U.ContextSliceSet;
                   ExtentRule := admissible view morphisms
  ResultKind     = U.Morphism                        // an instance v
```

**Vocabulary (re‑uses A.6.2).**
* **Types.** `U.Episteme`, `U.SubjectRef`, `U.Morphism`, `U.EpistemicViewing`.
* **Operators.**
  * `id    : U.Morphism(X→X)`
  * `compose(g,f) : U.Morphism(X→Z)` where `f:X→Y`, `g:Y→Z`
  * `apply(v, x:U.Episteme) : U.Episteme`
  * `dom(v), cod(v) : U.Episteme`
  * `subjectRef(·) : U.SubjectRef`
**Slot‑level discipline.**
Domain and codomain epistemes are instances of some `U.Episteme` species (typically `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, or `U.EpistemePublication`) whose episteme kinds each provide SlotSpecs (A.6.5) including at least:
  * `DescribedEntitySlot` (ValueKind `U.Entity`, RefKind `U.EntityRef`),
  * `GroundingHolonSlot?` (ValueKind `U.Holon`, RefKind `U.HolonRef`),
  * `ClaimGraphSlot` (ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`, by‑value),
  * `ViewpointSlot?` (ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`, RefKind `U.ViewpointRef`),
  * `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (ValueKind `U.ReferenceScheme`, by‑value),
  * and, where C.2.1+ is in use, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ViewSlot` and related slots.

Practical species of EpistemicViewing will very often take `X` and `Y` from the same `U.EpistemeKind`, but the pattern itself only requires that the SlotSpecs of the domain and codomain kinds be **compatible** in the sense of A.6.5, not literally identical.

**Relation to EFEM.**
* Every `U.EpistemicViewing` is an **EFEM morphism** with `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve` in the sense of A.6.2/C.2.1.
* It **inherits** P0–P5 from A.6.2, specialised to the case where the occupant of `DescribedEntitySlot` is unchanged.

#### 4.3 · Laws (EV‑0…EV‑6, over C.2.1 components)

All laws below are **in addition** to A.6.2’s EFEM laws P0–P5 and SHALL be read directly against C.2.1 components and A.6.5 SlotSpecs.

**EV‑0 · Species & DescribedEntityChangeMode.**

* Any morphism `v:X→Y` declared as `U.EpistemicViewing` **MUST**:
  * be a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (A.6.2), and
  * declare `describedEntityChangeMode(v) = preserve`.
* Consequently:
  * `DescribedEntitySlot` has the **same ValueKind and RefKind** in the episteme kind of `X` and `Y` (same `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity`);
  * `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)` **by definition** of the species.

**EV‑1 · Typed domain/codomain & DescriptionContext behaviour.**

For any `v:X→Y` in `U.EpistemicViewing`:
1. `X` and `Y` are instances of `U.Episteme` species whose episteme kinds both realise at least the core C.2.1 slots (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot?`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot?`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) and obey A.6.5. Many practical species of EpistemicViewing will take `X` and `Y` from the **same** `U.EpistemeKind`, but the A.6.3 pattern only requires **SlotSpec compatibility** between domain and codomain kinds (in the sense of A.6.5), not literal kind equality.

2. At the SlotKind level:
   * `DescribedEntitySlot` is **read‑only** (no change in `describedEntityRef`).
   * `GroundingHolonSlot`, if present, is:
     * either preserved exactly, or
     * changed only within an explicitly declared **grounding context** (e.g. normalising identifiers for the same plant or runtime), justified via a `Bridge` in the same ReferencePlane.
   * `ViewpointSlot`, if present, is:
     * either preserved (internal normalisation under the same viewpoint), or
     * changed only to another `U.ViewpointRef` **within a declared `U.MultiViewDescribing` family** (E.17.0), with a `CorrespondenceModel` providing witnesses.
3. For any episteme that is a `…Description`/`…Spec` (E.10.D2), `subjectRef` decodes to `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`. EpistemicViewing MUST:
   * preserve `DescribedEntityRef`,
   * preserve `BoundedContextRef` (unless a Bridge is explicitly cited),
   * treat `ViewpointRef` as in (2) above.

**EV‑2 · Effect‑free boundary (over EpistemeSlotGraph).**
EpistemicViewing remains **pure** in the EFEM sense:
* It may change **only C.2.1 components of the codomain episteme**:
  * `content : U.ClaimGraph` (e.g. filtering, aggregation, normalisation),
  * `viewpointRef` (under the constraints in EV‑1),
  * `representationSchemeRef` and `ReferenceScheme` (within a fixed representation family or under a declared `CorrespondenceModel`),
  * meta‑components (edition, provenance, status flags).
* It **MUST NOT**:
  * invoke `U.Mechanism` or `U.WorkEnactment` (measure, execute, actuate),
  * create or modify `U.PresentationCarrier` (no direct publishing to surfaces),
  * cross ReferencePlanes implicitly (plane crossings go through Bridges with CL penalties in Part F).

Any operational machinery (e.g. SAT/SMT solving, simulation, LLM tool‑use) MUST be modelled as a **separate `U.Mechanism`** that produces input epistemes or auxiliary artefacts consumed by the EpistemicViewing morphism.

**EV‑3 · No new intensional claims about the same DescribedEntity.**

Let `X` and `Y = apply(v,X)` with:
* `content_X`, `referenceScheme_X`,
* `content_Y`, `referenceScheme_Y`,
* shared `describedEntityRef` and (typically) `groundingHolonRef`.

Then:
* The set of claims about `<describedEntityRef, groundingHolonRef>` obtained by reading `content_Y` through `referenceScheme_Y` **MUST NOT strictly extend** what is already entailed, in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL, by `content_X` read through `referenceScheme_X` under the same ReferencePlane and context.
* Admissible changes:
  * re‑expression (changing representation, not truth conditions),
  * aggregation (e.g. summarising multiple claims into an explicitly derivable macro‑claim),
  * dropping some information (lossy projection), provided **no new atomic commitments** about the same described entity are introduced.
* Any intended strengthening of behavioural or structural commitments about the same entity **is not a valid EpistemicViewing**; it must be modelled either as:
  * a change in Intension (new D/S pair under A.7/E.10.D2), or
  * an A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting` plus a new Intension.

**EV‑4 · Functoriality & correspondence alignment.**

EpistemicViewing **inherits EFEM functoriality** and specialises it:

1. **Direct EpistemicViewing (same representation scheme).**
   Where `representationSchemeRef` and `ReferenceScheme` of `X` and `Y` are the same (up to declared normal forms), EpistemicViewing acts as a **strict functor** on ClaimGraphs:
   * `apply(id, X) = X`,
   * `apply(g ∘ f, X) = apply(g, apply(f, X))`,
   * `content` transformation corresponds to a structural ClaimGraph function.

2. **Correspondence‑based EpistemicViewing (representation changes).**
   When viewing relies on a `CorrespondenceModel` between epistemes or representation schemes:
   * the viewing morphism MUST reference that `CorrespondenceModel`,
   * compositions involving such viewings **MUST** publish witnesses (epistemes or proof objects) that squares commute **up to declared isomorphism** (oplax naturality is allowed, but corrections are deterministic and reproducible),
   * `describedEntityRef` and `groundingHolonRef` remain as in EV‑1; any transfer across contexts/planes goes via Bridges, not via hidden behaviour of the viewing.

**EV‑5 · Idempotency & determinism on fixed configuration.**

For any `v:X→Y` in `U.EpistemicViewing`, with fixed:
* `describedEntityRef`,
* `groundingHolonRef`,
* `viewpointRef`,
* `representationSchemeRef`,
* `referenceScheme`,
* and fixed `CorrespondenceModel` (if used),

the following MUST hold:
* **Idempotency.** `apply(v, apply(v, X))` is **isomorphic** to `apply(v, X)`:
  * same DescribedEntity and grounding holon,
  * same viewpoint and representation scheme,
  * ClaimGraphs differ, at most, by declared structural equivalence (e.g. normal form vs source form).
* **Determinism.** For fixed input and configuration, the result is uniquely determined (modulo declared equivalence). Any source of non‑determinism (random seeds, timing, external service state) MUST either:
  * be exposed as part of `content` / `meta` of `X`, or
  * be moved into a Mechanism outside the viewing morphism.

**EV‑6 · Applicability & MultiViewDescribing alignment.**

Each species of `U.EpistemicViewing` MUST:
1. Declare an **Applicability profile** (A.6.0) specifying:
   * permitted `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` (ValueKind of `DescribedEntitySlot`),
   * permitted `groundingHolonRef` classes and ReferencePlanes,
   * admissible `viewpointRef` ranges (possibly a named `U.ViewpointBundle`),
   * supported `representationSchemeRef` families.
1. For D/S epistemes in a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family (E.17.0):
   * preserve `DescribedEntityRef` of `DescriptionContext`,
   * either preserve `ViewpointRef` or change it within the declared viewpoint bundle, with any additional constraints recorded in the family’s `CorrespondenceModel`,
   * never widen `ClaimScope` beyond what EV‑3 permits.
3. Treat **any change of DescribedEntity** (even if “intuitively minor”, such as moving from subsystem to system) as **out of scope** for A.6.3; such moves belong to A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting`.

#### 4.4 · Profiles: `U.DirectEpistemicViewing` and `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing`

`U.EpistemicViewing` is further structured into two important species; both inherit EV‑0…EV‑6.

1. **`U.DirectEpistemicViewing` — self‑contained views.**
   * Domain and codomain epistemes share:
     * the same `representationSchemeRef` (up to declared normalisation),
     * the same `ReferenceScheme` (or a refinement which is conservative and structurally documented).
   * No external `CorrespondenceModel` is needed: the view is computed **solely from the input episteme** and, optionally, fixed configuration.
   * Typical cases:
     * internal normalisation (sorting, rewriting) of an engineering view;
     * filtering `U.ClaimGraph` to keep only safety‑relevant claims;
     * simplifying a proof‑oriented specification to a more operational form under the same semantics.

1. **`U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` — views relying on correspondence models.**
   * Viewing depends on:
     * one or more subject epistemes (e.g. requirements and design),
     * an explicit `CorrespondenceModel` that relates their ClaimGraphs and representation schemes.
   * The result is an episteme (often an `U.EpistemeView`) whose `describedEntityRef` matches that of the primary episteme, but whose content is computed **through** the correspondence links.
   * Typical cases:
     * ISO 42010‑style correspondences between architectural descriptions;
     * cross‑model views in model‑based systems engineering (MBSE), where view content is computed from multiple model fragments;
     * traceability‑based views aggregating requirements, design elements, and tests.

In both profiles:
* `CorrespondenceModel` remains an **episteme‑level artefact**, not a new kernel‑type hidden inside A.6.3.
* `U.EpistemicViewing` stays **view‑like**: it reveals what is already there under the correspondence; it does not perform Γ‑style constructions of new Intensions.

### 5 · Archetypal grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

#### 5.1 · Engineering system description → safety officer view (DirectEpistemicViewing)

*Context.*
A system team maintains a rich `SystemDescription` episteme for a plant holon `S` under an engineering viewpoint from TEVB. A safety officer needs a concise view showing only safety‑critical components, hazards, and mitigations.

*Shape.*

* **Domain `X`.**
  `X : U.SystemDescription` with:
  * `describedEntityRef(X) : U.SystemRef` (the plant `S`),
  * `groundingHolonRef(X) : U.HolonRef` (runtime environment),
  * `viewpointRef(X) : U.ViewpointRef` (engineering TEVB viewpoint),
  * `content(X) : U.ClaimGraph` (full behavioural & structural claims).
* **Codomain `Y`.**
  `Y : U.EpistemeView` with:
  * `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)`,
  * `groundingHolonRef(Y) = groundingHolonRef(X)`,
  * `viewpointRef(Y)` either equal to or a refinement of the original engineering viewpoint (TEVB safety sub‑viewpoint),
  * `content(Y)` containing only safety‑relevant claims, plus explicit aggregation nodes (e.g. hazard summaries).

`SafetyView : X→Y` is a **DirectEpistemicViewing**:
* `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`,
* only `content`, `viewpointRef` (within TEVB) and `meta` change,
* KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL checks show that every hazard/mitigation claim in `Y` is entailed by `X`,
* view is idempotent and deterministic given `X` and the selected safety profile.

This is the canonical “engineering view” archetype that later species in E.17.2/TEVB refer back to.

#### 5.2 · MVPK publication view normalisation (DirectEpistemicViewing)

*Context.*
MVPK emits a `TechCard` view `V_raw` for an arrow `f` in a morphism class (e.g. an ATS‑checked service). The publication pipeline wants a normalised view `V_norm` where:
* arrows are ordered canonically,
* units and names follow a fixed naming discipline,
* redundant cells are removed.

*Shape.*

* `X = V_raw`, `Y = V_norm`, both `U.EpistemeView` instances with:
  * same `describedEntityRef` (the morphism’s arrow or capability),
  * same `groundingHolonRef` (runtime/plant),
  * same `viewpointRef` (publication viewpoint),
  * same `representationSchemeRef` (TechCard schema).

`NormalizeTechCard : X→Y` is a **DirectEpistemicViewing**:
* changes only `content` and `meta` (e.g. “normalised at edition E”),
* is pure and idempotent (two passes give the same normal form),
* is conservative: no new claims about the arrow `f` appear; information is only reordered or discarded.

MVPK can rely on this as an A.6.3‑conformant step without restating EFEM laws.

#### 5.3 · Cross‑model consistency view (CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing)

*Context.*
A system has:
* a requirements episteme `R` (“what the system should do”), and
* a design episteme `D` (“how the system does it”),

both with `describedEntityRef` pointing to the same system holon `S`, but living in different notations and contexts. A systems engineer wants a view that shows **only those requirements that currently have design coverage**.

*Shape.*

* `R : U.SystemRequirementsDescription` with ClaimGraph `C_R`.
* `D : U.SystemDesignDescription` with ClaimGraph `C_D`.
* `CM : U.CorrespondenceModel` relating requirements to design elements.
* `Y : U.EpistemeView` with:
  * `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(R) = describedEntityRef(D) = S`,
  * `groundingHolonRef(Y)` inherited from `R`/`D` or declared via a Bridge,
  * `content(Y)` aggregating only those requirements in `C_R` for which `CM` records coverage in `C_D`.

`CoveredRequirementsView(R,D,CM) : X→Y` (with `X` a compound episteme or a bundle episteme over `R,D,CM`) is a **CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing**:
* relies essentially on `CM` (without it, the view is undefined — fail‑closed),
* must publish witnesses that two different ways of composing local correspondences give the same result up to declared equivalence,
* remains conservative: it does not assert that any requirement is covered unless that fact is recorded in `CM` and justified in `D`.

This archetype mirrors post‑2015 work on model synchronisation and bidirectional transformations, but anchored in the EpistemeSlotGraph.

### 6 · Consequences

* **Clear separation of viewing vs retargeting.**
  `U.EpistemicViewing` and `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (A.6.4) now **cleanly separate**:

  * “view of the same entity” vs “description of a different entity under a bridge”, and
  * vertical morphisms (`α` fixed) vs retargeting morphisms (α changes under KindBridge).

* **Stable backbone for multi‑view patterns.**
  Multi‑view description (E.17.0), viewpoint bundle libraries (E.17.1/E.17.2), and MVPK publication now share a **single notion of view morphism**, aligned with C.2.1 slots and the I/D/S discipline.

* **Slot‑level discipline for tools.**
  Tools implementing views (queries, projections, report generators, LLM‑based summarisation) must declare:

  * which SlotKinds they read,
  * which SlotKinds they may write,
  * and that `DescribedEntitySlot` is preserved.
    This removes ambiguity around “subject/object” changes and supports robust static checking.

* **Alignment with modern view/query practices.**
  The pattern aligns with:
  * ISO 42010:2011/2022 and its focus on **viewpoints**, **views**, and **correspondences** over an entity‑of‑interest;
  * SysML v2 “views‑as‑queries” paradigm, where views are queries over a stable model, not new models;
  * post‑2015 work on **optics** and **displayed categories**, treating views as structured projections over a fibred category of epistemes.

### 7 · Rationale & SoTA‑echoing  *(informative)*

* **Optics and displayed categories.**
  In categorical terms, epistemes form a category `Ep` fibred over a category of described entities `Ref` via `α : Ep → Ref`. EpistemicViewing corresponds to **vertical morphisms** that preserve α. Their behaviour closely tracks **profunctor optics**: the DescribedEntitySlot plays the role of the “focus index”, while ClaimGraphs and representation schemes act as the data being transformed. Recent work on optics (2018‑onwards) provides compositional laws that FPF leverages without committing to a specific optic calculus.

* **Multi‑view modelling and viewpoint libraries.**
  ISO 42010 and its successors, as well as MBSE practice from ~2015 onwards, have refined the separation between **viewpoints** (families of concerns, stakeholders, and notations) and **views** (instances under those viewpoints). `U.EpistemicViewing` gives FPF a substrate‑agnostic notion of “view” that can be instantiated for architecture descriptions, safety cases, or even research artefacts, while TEVB and E.17.0 specialise it to engineering holons.

* **Bidirectional transformations and consistency management.**
  Modern BX research treats views and consistency restoration as structured transformations between models, with consistency relations acting as correspondences. `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` echoes this practice but insists that:
  * viewing is **non‑creative** in intensional terms (no new commitments),
  * any strengthening or change of described entity is explicitly modelled as retargeting or Intension change.

* **Hybrid symbolic/latent representations.**
  Contemporary work on LLMs and neurosymbolic systems often toggles between:
  * symbolic specifications (logical, tabular, diagrammatic), and
  * distributed or latent representations used for computation.
    By treating `U.RepresentationScheme` and `U.RepresentationOperation` as first‑class episteme components, FPF allows EpistemicViewing to range over:
  * purely symbolic projections,
  * latent‑space projections,
  * or hybrids that invoke external mechanisms before applying a pure view, without changing the core laws.

### 8 · Conformance checklist (normative)

**CC‑A.6.3‑1 · EFEM species and DescribedEntityChangeMode.**
Any pattern that claims to define `U.EpistemicViewing` **SHALL**:

* declare itself a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (A.6.2),
* fix `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`,
* and state its Applicability profile (EoIClass, contexts, viewpoints, representation schemes).

**CC‑A.6.3‑2 · Slot‑level read/write discipline.**
For each species of EpistemicViewing, authors **MUST**:

* list the SlotKinds it **reads** (typically `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`),
* list the SlotKinds it **writes** (typically `ClaimGraphSlot`, optionally `ViewpointSlot`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, and `meta`),
* assert explicitly that `DescribedEntitySlot` is read‑only,
* and state any constraints on `GroundingHolonSlot` / `ViewpointSlot` changes.

This satisfies A.6.5 and C.2.1 checkpoint CC‑C.2.1‑5.

**CC‑A.6.3‑3 · DescriptionContext discipline (for D/S epistemes).**
When domain/codomain epistemes are `…Description`/`…Spec`:
* viewing laws SHALL be phrased in terms of `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`,
* `DescribedEntityRef` MUST be preserved,
* `BoundedContextRef` MUST be preserved unless a Bridge is explicitly cited,
* `ViewpointRef` MUST either be preserved or changed within a declared `U.ViewpointBundle`.

**CC‑A.6.3‑4 · Conservativity witness.**
For each species, authoring SHALL provide:
* a clear statement of what counts as a **new intensional claim** in the relevant discipline,
* and a sketch of how conservativity (EV‑3) is checked or approximated (e.g. via KD‑CAL entailment, proof obligations, or structural invariants).

**CC‑A.6.3‑5 · Profile classification.**
* Species that do not require a `CorrespondenceModel` MUST be marked as `U.DirectEpistemicViewing`.
* Species that do require such a model MUST be marked as `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` and SHALL:
  * document the shape of the `CorrespondenceModel`,
  * describe how witness epistemes ensure oplax naturality of compositions.

**CC‑A.6.3‑6 · Separation from Retargeting and Mechanisms.**
* Any species that may change `describedEntityRef` is **not** a conformant EpistemicViewing; it MUST be treated as `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (A.6.4) or as a different pattern.
* Any species that performs measurements, actuation, or other side‑effects MUST be declared as `U.Mechanism`/`U.WorkEnactment` and cannot be an EpistemicViewing.

### 9 · Mini‑checklist (for authors)

When you introduce a new “view” in FPF, check:
1. **Same described entity?**
   Does `describedEntityRef` stay the same? If not, this is **Retargeting**, not Viewing.

2. **Which slots move?**
   Have you listed exactly which SlotKinds you read/write, and shown that `DescribedEntitySlot` is read‑only?

3. **Conservative?**
   Can you explain, in your discipline’s terms, why the view does not introduce new claims about the same entity?

4. **Profile?**
   Is this a self‑contained projection (`U.DirectEpistemicViewing`) or does it depend on a `CorrespondenceModel` (`U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing`)?

5. **Context & viewpoint?**
   Have you stated:
   * the EoIClass for `DescribedEntitySlot`,
   * the contexts/ReferencePlanes you assume,
   * and the viewpoint bundle (if any) you operate under?

If all answers are crisp and the laws EV‑0…EV‑6 are satisfied, the pattern is a good candidate for `U.EpistemicViewing`.

## A.6.4 · **`U.EpistemicRetargeting` — describedEntity‑retargeting morphism** \[A]

**One‑line summary.** `U.EpistemicRetargeting` is the **describedEntity‑retargetning** species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`: an effect‑free episteme→episteme morphism that **intentionally changes what the episteme is about** (the occupant of `DescribedEntitySlot` in C.2.1) under a declared `KindBridge` and invariant, while remaining conservative with respect to that invariant.

**Status.** Normative [A] in **Part A (Kernel)**.
**Placement.** After **A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`**, before **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`**. 

**Builds on.**
A.6.0 `U.Signature`; A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`; A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`; A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`; A.7/E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline, `DescriptionContext`); C.2.1 `U.Episteme — Epistemes and their slot graph`; C.2/C.3 (KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL, ReferencePlane, Kind‑level reasoning); F.9 (Bridges, `KindBridge`, CL/CL^plane, SquareLaw witnesses).

**Used by.**
E.18 (E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation and other reinterpretation nodes); discipline packs for signal/spectrum transforms, data↔model retargetings, abstraction/refinement under kind‑invariants; KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL retargeting rules; future species for architecture and governance reinterpretations. 

### 1 · Problem frame

Many important operations on descriptions **change the object‑of‑talk** while preserving a structural or behavioural invariant:

* **Physical vs functional reinterpretation.**
  An episteme about a physical module (cabinet, rack, device) is re‑interpreted as an episteme about a function‑holon it realises. This is precisely what StructuralReinterpretation nodes in E.TGA attempt to do. 

* **Signal vs spectrum.**
  A time‑domain signal description is re‑targeted to a description of its frequency‑domain spectrum. The underlying invariant (typically energy or inner‑product) is preserved, but the “thing we talk about” changes from `time→value` trajectories to `frequency→amplitude/phase` distributions. 

* **Data vs model.**
  An episteme about raw observations (dataset) is turned into an episteme about a learned or estimated model, keeping an invariant such as likelihood, sufficient statistics, or predictive performance. 

All of these are **Ep→Ep transforms** that:
* do **not** change the Intension (`I`) directly (they operate on descriptions/specifications),
* do **not** merely slice or re‑express an episteme of the same entity (that would be EpistemicViewing, A.6.3),
* but **do change** the **DescribedEntity‑bundle** (`DescribedEntitySlot` and usually `GroundingHolonSlot`) under a formal bridge between kinds.

We need a single, reusable notion of **“epistemic retargeting”** that captures these operations as:
* **effect‑free** at the level of Work/Mechanism (EFEM discipline),
* **describedEntity‑retargeotating** in a controlled way,
* **invariant‑conservative** (no violation of the declared invariant between kinds),
* and **functorial** (retargetings compose cleanly and align with Bridges).

### 2 · Problem

Without a dedicated pattern for EpistemicRetargeting:
1. **Retargeting is silently confused with viewing.**
   Structural reinterpretations (e.g., component→function, signal→spectrum, data→model) can be mistakenly treated as “just another view” of the same entity, even though they change `describedEntityRef`. This hides the fact that the **object‑of‑talk** has changed and that a `KindBridge` and invariant are required.

2. **Invariants float untyped.**
   Fourier‑style moves, structural reinterpretations, and abstraction/refinement steps are often justified by “energy is preserved”, “this component realises that function”, or “this model summarises those data” — but these invariants are not connected to the episteme morphism class. Without a dedicated species:

   * invariants live only in text,
   * CL‑penalties and ReferencePlane crossings cannot be tracked systematically (Part F).

3. **Cross‑kind reasoning has no canonical morphism.**
   A general EFEM (A.6.2) can change `describedEntityRef` by setting `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`, but:

   * nothing states what that means at the level of kinds (`Kind(describedEntityRef(X))` vs `Kind(describedEntityRef(Y))`),
   * nothing connects these moves to `KindBridge` and ReferencePlane policies.

4. **StructuralReinterpretation is ad‑hoc.**
   E.TGA currently hosts StructuralReinterpretation as a special node, but its semantics are much closer to a generic “retargeting under a bridge” pattern than to something specific to graph‑based architectures. Without a core pattern:

   * StructuralReinterpretation risks duplicating retargeting logic,
   * other discipline packs may reinvent their own ad‑hoc re‑targetings.

5. **I/D/S discipline is left underspecified.**
   For descriptions/specifications (`…Description` / `…Spec`), retargeting **changes `DescribedEntityRef` in `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`** (E.10.D2), but must say what happens to context and viewpoint. Without an explicit pattern, these decisions get scattered across different E‑patterns instead of being governed centrally. 

### 3 · Forces

* **Changing the object‑of‑talk vs constructing something new.**
  Retargeting should express **“talking about a different but bridge‑related entity”**, not arbitrary construction of a new Intension/episteme. The invariant lives **across** the pair of entities, not inside a single episteme.

* **Invariants may be lossy but must be explicit.**
  A retargeting is often **lossy** (e.g. data→model, signal→spectrum, structural→functional view), but:

  * it must preserve an explicitly declared invariant (energy, behaviour, statistics),
  * any additional strengthening must be modelled as a change of Intension plus new D/S, not as a hidden side‑effect.

* **Bridges and CL‑penalties.**
  Retargeting often crosses:
  * Kind‑planes (different `Kind(U.Entity)`),
  * ReferencePlanes (different observability or abstraction regimes).
    Part F already has `KindBridge`, plane Bridges and CL‑penalties; EpistemicRetargeting must **re‑use** them instead of introducing its own notion of “link”.

* **Functors over `α : Ep → Ref`.**
  In the fibred view of epistemes (C.2 / A.6.2), `α : Ep → Ref` maps each episteme to its described entity. EpistemicViewing preserves α (`α(v) = id`). Retargeting must:
  * change α in a controlled way (`α(r) = b : R₁→R₂` in `Ref`),
  * align with `KindBridge` and plane Bridges used for those base arrows.

* **Slot discipline and modularity.**
  C.2.1 and A.6.5 give epistemes a precise `SlotKind`/`ValueKind`/`RefKind` structure, including `DescribedEntitySlot` and `GroundingHolonSlot`. Retargeting laws must be stated **at the slot level**, not on ad‑hoc “fields”, so they can be reused across E.TGA, MVPK, and discipline packs.

### 4 · Solution — `U.EpistemicRetargeting` as EFEM profile (`describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`)

#### 4.1 · Informal definition

> **Definition (informal).**
> `U.EpistemicRetargeting` is the **describedEntity‑retargeting species** of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`.
> A `U.EpistemicRetargeting r : X→Y`:
>
> * takes an input episteme `X` and produces an output episteme `Y`,
> * **changes** the occupant of `DescribedEntitySlot` (`describedEntityRef(Y) ≠ describedEntityRef(X)`),
> * relates the kinds of the old and new described entities via an explicit `KindBridge` in the appropriate ReferencePlane,
> * preserves a declared **invariant** across the pair of entities (e.g. energy, behaviour, sufficient statistics),
> * is **effect‑free** at the level of Work/Mechanism (EFEM discipline),
> * and composes functorially with other retargetings and viewings.

In C.2.1 terms, `U.EpistemicRetargeting` **re‑indexes** an episteme along a base‑level bridge: it moves the `DescribedEntitySlot` (and often the `<DescribedEntitySlot, GroundingHolonSlot>` bundle) along a `KindBridge`, while re‑expressing `content : U.ClaimGraph` and `referenceScheme` so that the declared invariant continues to hold at the new target. 

#### 4.2 · Signature (A.6.0 / A.6.5 alignment)

**Signature header.**
`U.EpistemicRetargeting` is a **Morphism‑kind** under A.6.0, specialised from EFEM:

```
SubjectBlock
  SubjectKind    = U.EpistemicRetargeting
  BaseType       = ⟨X:U.Episteme, Y:U.Episteme⟩      // carrier pair
  Quantification = SliceSet := U.ContextSliceSet;
                   ExtentRule := admissible retargeting morphisms
  ResultKind     = U.Morphism                        // an instance r
```

**Vocabulary (re‑uses A.6.2).**

* **Types.** `U.Episteme`, `U.SubjectRef`, `U.Morphism`, `U.EpistemicRetargeting`.
* **Operators.**

  * `id    : U.Morphism(X→X)`
  * `compose(g,f) : U.Morphism(X→Z)` where `f:X→Y`, `g:Y→Z`
  * `apply(r, x:U.Episteme) : U.Episteme`
  * `dom(r), cod(r) : U.Episteme`
  * `subjectRef(·) : U.SubjectRef`
* **Slot‑level discipline.**
  Domain and codomain epistemes are instances of some `U.Episteme` species (typically `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, or `U.EpistemePublication`) whose episteme kinds each provide SlotSpecs (A.6.5) including at least:

  * `DescribedEntitySlot` (ValueKind `U.Entity`, RefKind `U.EntityRef`, usually restricted to an `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity`),
  * `GroundingHolonSlot?` (ValueKind `U.Holon`, RefKind `U.HolonRef`),
  * `ClaimGraphSlot` (ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`, by‑value),
  * `ViewpointSlot?` (ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`, RefKind `U.ViewpointRef`),
  * `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (ValueKind `U.ReferenceScheme`, by‑value),
  * and, where C.2.1+ is in use, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ViewSlot` and related slots.

The pattern only requires **SlotSpec compatibility** between domain and codomain kinds (in the sense of A.6.5); they need not be literally the same kind.

**Relation to EFEM and Viewing.**

* Every `U.EpistemicRetargeting` is an **EFEM morphism** with `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget` in the sense of A.6.2/C.2.1.
* It **inherits** EFEM laws P0–P5 and adds retargeting‑specific obligations ER‑0…ER‑6 below.
* `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) covers the complementary case `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`, where the object‑of‑talk does not change.

#### 4.3 · Laws (ER‑0…ER‑6, over C.2.1 components)

All laws below are **in addition** to A.6.2’s EFEM laws P0–P5 and SHALL be read directly against C.2.1 components and A.6.5 SlotSpecs. 

**ER‑0 · Species & DescribedEntityChangeMode.**

* Any morphism `r:X→Y` declared as `U.EpistemicRetargeting` **MUST**:
  * be a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (A.6.2), and
  * declare `describedEntityChangeMode(r) = retarget`.
* Consequently:
 * the pair `<DescribedEntitySlot, GroundingHolonSlot>` is the **target bundle** for the change (as in C.2.1 §7.3: DescribedEntity‑bundle retargeting),
 * `DescribedEntitySlot` is **write‑enabled** (unlike Viewing) but only under the constraints below,
  * there exist entities `T₁, T₂ : U.Entity` such that:
    * `describedEntityRef(X) = T₁`,
    * `describedEntityRef(Y) = T₂`,
    * `T₁ ≠ T₂` (as Ref/identity), and
    * `Kind(T₁)` and `Kind(T₂)` are related by a `KindBridge` in Part F’s sense (with declared CL^k). 

**ER‑1 · Typed domain/codomain & DescribedEntity‑bundle behaviour.**

For any `r:X→Y` in `U.EpistemicRetargeting`:

1. `X` and `Y` are instances of `U.Episteme` species whose episteme kinds both realise at least the core C.2.1 slots (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot?`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot?`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) and obey A.6.5.

2. At the SlotKind level:

   * `DescribedEntitySlot`:
     * **MUST change** (`describedEntityRef(Y) ≠ describedEntityRef(X)`),
     * the ValueKinds for the slot in the domain and codomain kinds **MUST** be related via an `EoIClass` pair that the `KindBridge` covers (e.g. `PhysicalModule` ↔ `FunctionHolon`, `Signal` ↔ `Spectrum`, `Dataset` ↔ `StatisticalModel`). 

   * `GroundingHolonSlot`, if present:
     * is either preserved exactly (`groundingHolonRef(Y) = groundingHolonRef(X)`), or
     * changed only along a declared holon‑Bridge in the same ReferencePlane (for example, moving from one runtime to another under a deployment bridge) with CL^plane penalties recorded in Part F.

   * `ViewpointSlot`, if present:
     * is either preserved, or
     * changed only within a declared `U.ViewpointBundle` (E.17.1/E.17.2), with the corresponding `CorrespondenceModel` explaining how the invariant is maintained under the new viewpoint.

1. For any episteme that is a `…Description`/`…Spec` (E.10.D2), `subjectRef` decodes to `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`. Under EpistemicRetargeting:
   * `DescribedEntityRef` **MUST** change from `T₁` to `T₂` as in ER‑0,
   * `BoundedContextRef` is:
     * either preserved, or
     * changed along an explicit Context‑Bridge (E.10.D1, Part F),
   * `ViewpointRef` is treated as in (2) above (preserved or mapped within a bundle), and any resulting change in admissible claims is governed by ER‑2.

The pair `<DescribedEntitySlot, GroundingHolonSlot>` is treated as a **target bundle**: many practical retargetings work at the level of this bundle rather than DescribedEntity alone, especially in E.TGA. 

**ER‑2 · Invariant‑based conservativity (lossy but lawful).**

Let `X` and `Y = apply(r,X)` with:
* `describedEntityRef(X) = T₁`, `describedEntityRef(Y) = T₂`,
* `KindBridge(T₁,T₂)` and associated invariant `Inv` declared for this species (e.g. energy, behavioural relation, likelihood),
* `content_X`, `referenceScheme_X`,
* `content_Y`, `referenceScheme_Y`,
* `groundingHolonRef_X`, `groundingHolonRef_Y`.

Then:
1. There MUST exist a KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL expression of `Inv` such that:
   * all claims about `Inv` that can be derived by reading `content_Y` through `referenceScheme_Y` relative to `<T₂, groundingHolonRef_Y>`
     **are entailed by**
     claims about `Inv` derivable from `content_X` through `referenceScheme_X` relative to `<T₁, groundingHolonRef_X>`. 

2. Retargeting, as an EFEM instance, **may**:
   * discard information not needed to maintain `Inv` (lossy summarisation),
   * change representation schemes (e.g. time vs frequency domain),
   * move to different abstraction levels or ReferencePlanes (with Bridges and CL penalties declared),
   but **MUST NOT** violate the declared invariant.

3. Any intended change that **strengthens** commitments about `Inv` beyond what is derivable from `X` **is not a valid EpistemicRetargeting**. It must be modelled as:
   * a change of Intension (new D/S pair under A.7/E.10.D2), or
   * a chain of retargetings and Intension updates explicitly recorded in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL.

**ER‑3 · Functoriality, α‑reindexing & SquareLaw witnesses.**

EpistemicRetargeting **inherits EFEM functoriality** and specialises it to the retargeting case:

1. At the `Ep` level:
   * `apply(id, X) = X` (no retargeting),
   * `apply(r₂ ∘ r₁, X) = apply(r₂, apply(r₁, X))` whenever domains/codomains match,
   * the composite `r₂∘r₁` has `describedEntityRef(X) = T₁` and `describedEntityRef(cod(r₂∘r₁)) = T₃`, with a composed `KindBridge(T₁,T₃)` whenever the Bridges of `r₁` and `r₂` compose.

2. At the `Ref` level, under `α : Ep → Ref`:
   * each retargeting `r` induces a base arrow `α(r) : R₁→R₂` in `Ref`, compatible with the `KindBridge` used in ER‑0,
   * the square formed by:
     * `X→Y` in `Ep` (retargeting),
     * `α(X)→α(Y)` in `Ref` (base retargeting),
     * any measurement or evaluation morphisms on either side,
       **MUST** commute **up to a declared SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** (Part F / E.TGA), documenting that evaluating then retargeting vs retargeting then evaluating yields equivalent results (modulo CL‑penalties).

2. When retargetings use CorrespondenceModels between epistemes (e.g. aligning detailed hardware layouts with function networks), they MUST:
   * reference the CorrespondenceModel explicitly,
   * publish witness epistemes that certify commutativity of key squares, analogous to EV‑4 but now across **different described entities.**

**ER‑4 · Idempotency & determinism on fixed Bridge/invariant.**

For any `r:X→Y` in `U.EpistemicRetargeting`, with fixed:
* `KindBridge(T₁,T₂)` and ReferencePlane policies,
* invariant `Inv`,
* configuration (ContextSlice, representation families, CorrespondenceModels),

the following MUST hold:

* **Idempotency.**
  Applying `r` twice does not further change the described entity or invariant‑relevant content:
  * `apply(r, apply(r, X))` is **isomorphic** (in the EFEM sense) to `apply(r, X)`,
  * `describedEntityRef` is already `T₂` after the first application,
  * `content` and `referenceScheme` differ at most by declared structural equivalence (e.g. normal forms at the new target).

* **Determinism.**
  For fixed input `X` and fixed Bridge/invariant configuration, the result is uniquely determined modulo declared equivalence. Any source of non‑determinism (randomness, time, external service state) MUST either:
  * be made explicit as part of `content`/`meta` of `X`, or
  * be moved to a `U.Mechanism` outside the retargeting morphism.

**ER‑5 · Applicability, EoI‑pairs & CL‑discipline.**

Each species of `U.EpistemicRetargeting` MUST declare an **Applicability profile** (A.6.0) that includes:

1. **EoI‑pairs.**
   Admissible pairs of `EoIClass`es (ValueKinds of `DescribedEntitySlot` for domain and codomain), for example:
   * `(PhysicalModule, FunctionHolon)`,
   * `(Signal, Spectrum)`,
   * `(Dataset, StatisticalModel)`.

   For each such pair, the pattern MUST reference the appropriate `KindBridge` species in Part F.

2. **Grounding constraints.**
   Permitted classes of `groundingHolonRef` and ReferencePlanes, including whether:
   * grounding must stay within the same holon,
   * or may move along specific holon Bridges with CL^plane penalties.

3. **Viewpoint/context constraints.**
   Whether retargeting is allowed for all viewpoints or only for specific `U.ViewpointBundle`s (TEVB etc.), and any requirements on `BoundedContextRef`.

4. **CL‑discipline.**
   Minimum CL^k and CL^plane required for the Bridges used, aligning with F.9 and E.TGA’s StructuralReinterpretation rules.

Any attempt to apply a retargeting outside this Applicability profile is **ill‑typed**.

**ER‑6 · Compatibility with Viewing and Mechanisms.**

1. **Separation from Viewing.**

   * Any morphism that **does not change** `describedEntityRef` (and keeps `DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve`) belongs to A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`, not to `U.EpistemicRetargeting`.
   * Any morphism that **does** change `describedEntityRef` **MUST NOT** be declared as `U.EpistemicViewing`; it is either:
     * a `U.EpistemicRetargeting`, or
     * a more general pattern that composes several retargetings and Intension changes.

   In any composite `V∘r` or `r∘V`, describedEntity changes are localised to retargeting steps; Viewing steps are always `describedEntityChangeMode = preserve`.

2. **Separation from Mechanisms.**

   * Retargeting MAY depend on artefacts produced by `U.Mechanism` (e.g., computing a Fourier transform, fitting a model), but those are separate Work/Mechanism steps.
   * `U.EpistemicRetargeting` itself remains **effect‑free**: it rearranges epistemes, slots and ClaimGraphs, but does not perform measurements or actuation.

### 5 · Archetypal grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

**Tell.**
EpistemicRetargeting captures **“same invariant, different described entity”** moves:

* we stop talking about “this cabinet” and start talking about “the routing function it realises”;
* we stop talking about “this signal over time” and start talking about “its spectrum over frequency”;
* we stop talking about “this dataset” and start talking about “a model class with parameters θ learned from it”.

In each case, what remains stable is an **invariant** (behaviour, energy, likelihood), not the described entity itself.

**Show 1 — StructuralReinterpretation in E.TGA.** 
* `X` describes a physical module holon `S_phys`.
* `Y` describes a function holon `S_func`.
* A `KindBridge(S_phys, S_func)` expresses “this module realises that function”.
* A StructuralReinterpretation node in E.TGA is an instance of `U.EpistemicRetargeting` whose invariant is the behaviour relation between `S_phys` and `S_func`.

**Show 2 — Signal↔Spectrum.**
* `X` describes a time‑domain signal `s(t)`; `DescribedEntityRef(X) = S_time`.
* `Y` describes its spectrum `S(ω)`; `DescribedEntityRef(Y) = S_freq`.
* `KindBridge(S_time, S_freq)` encodes Fourier duality in the relevant ReferencePlane.
* The invariant is energy (or inner product), expressed as a KD‑CAL statement; EpistemicRetargeting ensures that energy‑related claims in `Y` are entailed by `X`.

**Show 3 — Data→Model.**
* `X` describes a dataset `D` (observations); `DescribedEntityRef(X) = S_data`.
* `Y` describes a model `M` (e.g. a parametric family with learned parameters); `DescribedEntityRef(Y) = S_model`.
* `KindBridge(S_data, S_model)` encodes the intended data→model relation (e.g. MLE, Bayesian posterior).
* The invariant is likelihood or predictive performance; the retargeting laws ensure `Y` does not claim more about this invariant than is supported by `X`.

### 6 · Consequences

* **Clear separation of Viewing vs Retargeting.**
  A.6.3 and A.6.4 now jointly distinguish:
  * **views**: same `DescribedEntityRef`, possible representation/viewpoint changes;
  * **retargetings**: different `DescribedEntityRef` under `KindBridge` and invariants.

* **Canonical home for StructuralReinterpretation.**
  E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation becomes a **species of `U.EpistemicRetargeting`**, not an ad‑hoc special node. This reduces duplication and clarifies how CL penalties and Bridges are used.

* **Invariants become first‑class.**
  Retargeting makes invariants explicit and type‑checked: every such morphism must state what it preserves and how that is expressed in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL.

* **Safer cross‑plane reasoning.**
  ReferencePlane crossings and kind‑level moves are handled via existing Bridges (Part F), with CL^plane/CL^k penalties and SquareLaw witnesses, instead of hidden in implementation details.

* **Better integration with I/D/S.**
  For `…Description`/`…Spec` epistemes, retargeting is the only place where `DescribedEntityRef` in `DescriptionContext` is allowed to change; all other I/D/S‑level operations (Describe/Specify, Viewing) keep it fixed. 

### 7 · Rationale & SoTA‑echoing  *(informative)*
* **Fibrations and base‑change (displayed categories, 2017+).**
  With epistemes forming a category `Ep` fibred over `Ref` via `α : Ep → Ref` (C.2 / A.6.2), EpistemicViewing corresponds to **vertical morphisms** (`α(v) = id`), while EpistemicRetargeting corresponds to **reindexing along base arrows** (`α(r) = b : R₁→R₂`). This lines up with base‑change and transport along fibrations in category theory.

* **Structured cospans and reinterpretation.**
  Modern work on structured cospans and open systems uses cospans and their morphisms to move between different presentations of a system while preserving a notion of interface/behaviour. Retargeting plays a similar role: it moves from one entity kind to another while preserving a declared invariant.

* **Fourier‑style dualities.**
  In signal processing and physics, Fourier and related transforms are often treated as isometries between function spaces, preserving energy while changing the domain of discourse. `U.EpistemicRetargeting` abstracts this pattern: the invariant is codified in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL; the morphism explicitly changes the described entity along a `KindBridge`.

* **Data/model duality in ML.**
  Contemporary ML workflows cycle between data and models; invariants such as likelihood, risk, and calibration matter more than raw equality of ClaimGraphs. Retargeting gives a structured way to talk about data→model (and, potentially, model→data) moves as episteme morphisms, rather than untyped “training” steps.

* **Consistency management and abstraction.**
  In model‑driven and bidirectional transformation literature, abstraction and refinement transfers information between models with different subject domains. Treating these as retargetings with explicit Bridges and invariants makes their assumptions amenable to CL accounting and KD‑CAL reasoning, instead of hiding them in tooling.

### 8 · Conformance checklist (normative)

**CC‑A.6.4‑1 · EFEM species and DescribedEntityChangeMode.**
Any pattern that claims to define `U.EpistemicRetargeting` **SHALL**:

* declare itself a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (A.6.2),
* fix `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`,
* and state its Applicability profile (EoI‑pairs, contexts, viewpoints, representation schemes, invariants).

**CC‑A.6.4‑2 · Slot‑level read/write discipline.**
For each species of EpistemicRetargeting, authors **MUST**:
* list the SlotKinds it **reads** (at least `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, plus any C.2.1+ slots used),
* list the SlotKinds it **writes** (at least `DescribedEntitySlot`, typically also `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, and `meta`),
* state explicitly how `GroundingHolonSlot` and `ViewpointSlot` behave (preserved vs bridged),
* reference A.6.5 to show that SlotSpecs remain consistent across domain/codomain kinds.

**CC‑A.6.4‑3 · Bridge & invariant declaration.**
Each species SHALL:
* identify the relevant `KindBridge` species (and, where applicable, plane Bridges),
* declare the invariant(s) it preserves (in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL terms),
* sketch how invariant preservation is checked or approximated (e.g. through proofs, tests, or statistical guarantees).

**CC‑A.6.4‑4 · SquareLaw‑retargeting witnesses.**
For retargetings that interact with E.TGA or other graph‑level transductions, authors **MUST**:
* describe the commutative squares (or more general diagrams) that express “evaluate then retarget = retarget then evaluate” up to equivalence,
* identify the corresponding SquareLaw‑retargeting witnesses and how they are represented as epistemes.

**CC‑A.6.4‑5 · D/S‑context behaviour.**
For retargetings over `…Description`/`…Spec` epistemes:
* laws MUST be phrased in terms of `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`,
* `DescribedEntityRef` MUST change in a way consistent with the declared `KindBridge`,
* `BoundedContextRef` MUST either be preserved or changed only via explicit Context‑Bridges,
* `ViewpointRef` MUST either be preserved or change within a declared `U.ViewpointBundle`.

**CC‑A.6.4‑6 · Separation from Viewing and Mechanisms.**
* Any species that leaves `describedEntityRef` unchanged is **not** a conformant EpistemicRetargeting; it belongs to `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) or another EFEM species.
* Any species that performs measurements, actuation, or other side‑effects MUST be declared as `U.Mechanism`/`U.WorkEnactment` and cannot be an EpistemicRetargeting.

### 9 · Mini‑checklist (for authors)

When you think you need “retargeting” in FPF, ask:

1. **Does `describedEntityRef` change?**
   If no, this is Viewing (A.6.3), not Retargeting.

2. **Is there a `KindBridge` between old and new entities?**
   If not, you probably need to introduce one in Part F or rethink the Intension, not fudge a retargeting.

3. **What invariant are you preserving?**
   Write it down in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL terms. If you cannot, retargeting is underspecified.

4. **How do `GroundingHolonRef`, context and viewpoint behave?**
   Explicitly state whether they stay the same, move along Bridges, or are out of scope.

5. **Can the operation be factored as Mechanism + pure retargeting?**
   If the step needs computation (FFT, model fitting), separate the Mechanism from the EpistemicRetargeting.

### 10 · Relations

* **Specialises / is specialised by.**
  * Specialises A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` as the `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget` profile.
  * Complements A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing` (describedEntity‑preserving EFEM) as the “retargeting” counterpart.

* **Constrained by.**
  * A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` for SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline.
  * C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` for episteme components and `DescribedEntitySlot`/`GroundingHolonSlot`.
  * E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline; `DescriptionContext`).
  * Part F (Bridges, `KindBridge`, ReferencePlane crossings, CL/CL^plane).
  * E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE naming rules, especially on `…Slot`/`…Ref` and ban on Subject/Object in episteme tech names).

* **Consumed by.**
  * E.18 (E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation and other cross‑kind architecture transformations).
  * E.17.0/E.17 (for cases where publication needs to move between different entities‑of‑interest but preserve invariants).
  * KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL rules that reason about retargeting and invariant preservation across different described entities.




---

## A.6.5 — **U.RelationSlotDiscipline** · SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline for n‑ary relations  \[A]

**Plain‑name.** Relation slot discipline.

**Status.** Normative (Core).
**Placement.** Part A, cluster A.IV “Architheory Kernel”; directly under A.6.0 `U.Signature` and alongside A.6.1–A.6.4.
**Depends on.**
– A.1 `U.Holon` (holonic carrier model).
– A.6.0 `U.Signature` (universal morphism/relationship signatures). 
– A.7 (Strict Distinction; I/D/S vs Surface).
– E.8 (pattern authoring order & SoTA discipline). 
– E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE: Tech/Plain registers, naming guards). 

**Coordinates with.**
– C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` (episteme slots: DescribedEntity, GroundingHolon, ClaimGraph, Viewpoint, View, ReferenceScheme).
– C.3.* Kind‑CAL (Kinds, KindSignature, KindBridge). 
– F.18 (name governance; twin‑register discipline). 

### 1 · Problem frame

FPF relies heavily on **n‑ary relations and morphisms**:

* episteme component layouts (`U.EpistemeKind` in C.2.1),
* role enactment and assignment,
* method/service signatures,
* guards and bridges in Part B/C,
* publication and view operators in Part E, and any other `U.Signature` whose **Vocabulary** row declares n-ary relations or operators across Part A/B/C/E.

In practice, existing episteme and drafts **frequently conflate**:
1. the **place** in a relation (“the 2nd argument, named Subject”),
2. the **kind of value** that may occupy that place (`U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, …), and
3. the **reference/identifier** we actually store there (`…Id`, `…Ref`).

This produces subtle bugs:
* misuse of “Subject/Object” as slot names for very different kinds,
* “Ref” suffix attached to both **entities and fields**,
* mixed reasoning about “role”, “slot”, and “object”,
* fragile substitution rules (“can I plug this module here?”) that depend on informal judgement.

`U.RelationSlotDiscipline` pins a **single, reusable discipline** over `U.Signature` so that **every position in a relation** is described with:

* a **SlotKind** — *where* in the relation,
* a **ValueKind** — *what sort of thing* may occupy that place, and
* a **RefKind** — *how we point at it* in episteme (identifier / handle), if at all.

This pattern makes slot discipline explicit and shareable across **epistemes, roles, methods, services, bridges, guards, and all other `U.Signature`d calculi**: any “parameter list”, “port list”, or “coordinate tuple” for an n-ary relation in FPF **is** a set of SlotSpecs governed by this discipline.

### 2 · Problem (symptoms in FPF)

Typical failure modes the pattern is designed to eliminate:

1. **Slot vs value vs ref confusion.**
   episteme fields such as `DescribedEntityRef` are sometimes treated as:

   * the **slot** (“the described entity position”),
   * the **value kind** (“the described entity type”), and
   * a **reference field** (“this is the pointer we store”).
     Reasoning about substitution (“can I swap one described entity for another?”) then mixes three levels at once.

2. **Kernel types misused as slot names.**
   Kernel concepts like `U.Entity` or `U.Holon` are used directly as slot names (“the `U.Entity` of this episteme”), hiding the difference between:

   * the abstract **Kind** (`U.Entity` as intensional universe), and
   * the **place** where one such entity is used in a particular relation.

3. **“Role” overloaded as slot.**
   In relation signatures and structural calculi, “role” has crept in as a synonym for “argument position”: “the role of the subject”, “the role of the provider”. This clashes with `U.Role` in RoleEnactment and makes it hard to distinguish:

   * **holonic role** (mask worn by a system), from
   * **slot** (position in a relation).

4. **Ref‑suffix drift.**
   In the absence of a discipline, the suffix `…Ref` is attached to:

   * entity kinds (`U.EntityRef` interpreted as “the entity itself”),
   * episteme fields (`describedEntityRef`),
   * sometimes even to slots (“DescribedEntityRefSlot”).
     That makes it impossible to read signatures and know whether we talk about:
   * a **conceptual value** (pass‑by‑value), or
   * a **reference/identifier** (pass‑by‑reference).

5. **Substitution rules not localisable.**
   When the slot/value/ref layers are not separated:

   * we cannot state “you may substitute **any instance of ValueKind V** in Slot S”, nor
   * “this Bridge only changes RefKind, not ValueKind”.
     This blocks clean use of A.6.0 `U.Signature` as a shared calculus for method/role/episteme signatures.

6. **Episteme‑specific slots not standardised.**
   For epistemes, the positions “what is this about?”, “in which holon is it grounded?”, “what ClaimGraph is inside?” re‑appear across patterns.
   Without a shared slot discipline, each pattern names these ad‑hoc, breaking the ability to state **universal laws** over episteme morphisms (A.6.2–A.6.4).

The result: **local convenience, global incoherence** — exactly what A.6.0 and E.10 are supposed to prevent.

---

### 3 · Forces

* **F1 · Simplicity vs expressiveness.**
  Engineers need a **small number of concepts** they can hold in mind while reading a signature; yet we must express:

  * where a parameter sits,
  * which kinds it can take,
  * whether it’s by value/by reference,
  * and how substitution behaves.

* **F2 · Cross‑disciplinary reuse.**
  Slot discipline must work for:
  * logical relations (KD‑CAL, LOG‑CAL),
  * episteme structures (C.2.1),
  * systems/roles/methods (A/B),
  * services and APIs (including Method/Service interfaces),
  * guards, bridges, and flows in E.TGA,
  * and publication operations (E.17).
    A scheme that is too domain-specific (e.g. “database attributes only”) won’t scale; the same discipline must underlie **all** `U.Signature`d argument/port lists.

* **F3 · Alignment with existing tooling.**
  Tooling stacks already operate with:

  * typed parameters and records,
  * identifiers vs values vs references,
  * sometimes row‑polymorphic fields or effect annotations.
    FPF must line up with this practice enough that signatures can be implemented without inventing a parallel type system.

* **F4 · I/D/S discipline.**
  Strict distinction (A.7, E.10.D2) already separates **intensional objects**, their **descriptions**, and **specifications**. The same kind of discipline is needed inside relations:

  * slot ≠ value ≠ reference,
  * system role ≠ slot name,
  * describedEntity ≠ guard.

* **F5 · Didactic primacy and naming discipline.**
  E.8 and E.10 demand patterns that are:

  * teachable (Tell‑Show‑Show examples, explicit biases), 
  * lexically guarded (Tech/Plain split, explicit head‑nouns). 
    Slot discipline must integrate seamlessly with that.

### 4 · Solution — SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind triple

#### 4.1 · Three layers for every argument position

`U.RelationSlotDiscipline` extends `U.Signature` with a **three-layer description** for every argument position (whether we call it “parameter”, “slot”, “coordinate”, or “port” in colloquial prose).
In **normative** text, the canonical word is **slot**, and the canonical carrier is a **SlotSpec** triple (A.6.0).

1. **SlotKind (place in relation).**
   *How this position is denoted in the Signature and what is fixed about it by the relation’s definition.*
   – Examples: `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ServiceEndpointSlot`, `CallerHolonSlot`, `MetricSlot`.
   – SlotKind is **structural**: it picks out **one distinguished place** in the argument/port list of a given relation or operator; it does **not** name a “role” played by the occupant.
   – For an n-ary relation declared in a `U.Signature`, the pair *(Signature id, SlotKind)* identifies a **slot**; positional indices are merely a presentation-level enumeration of these slots.
   – What an occupant “does” in that place (its contribution to laws, constraints, effects) is governed by the **laws over the Signature** and by the corresponding ValueKind, not by SlotKind-as-“role”.

2. **ValueKind (kind of occupant).**
   *Which kinds of things may occupy this position in principle (at the intensional level).*
   – Examples: `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, `U.Method`, `U.Episteme`, `U.ClaimGraph`, `U.Viewpoint`, `U.Characteristic`, `U.ReferenceScheme`.
   – ValueKind is a **Kind** (C.3.*) or another kernel‑level type; it is **not** a slot and never carries `*Slot`/`*Ref` suffixes.

3. **RefKind (how we store / refer).**
   *What reference/identifier we actually store in episteme when we fill this slot.*
   – Examples: `U.EntityRef`, `U.HolonRef`, `U.MethodRef`, `U.EpistemeRef`, `U.ViewpointRef`, `U.SurfaceRef`, (optionally) `U.ClaimGraphRef` if a Context chooses to reference claim graphs rather than store them by value.
   – RefKind is **about references, not values**; it usually points to an editioned artifact (A.7, F.15) and carries the `.edition` field when pinning a phase.

**Discipline:**
* Each declared argument position in a `U.Signature` **MUST** be described by:
   * a SlotKind (name and documentation),
   * a ValueKind (type of permissible occupants),
   * and either a RefKind or an explicit declaration “**by‑value**” (no RefKind; the value is embedded).
* SlotKind and ValueKind are **intensional**; RefKind is **representational**. This mirrors I/D/S: *slot* describes structure, *value* describes what can sit there, *ref* describes how we point to concrete instances.

#### 4.2 · Naming discipline: `*Slot` and `*Ref`

This pattern introduces the following **lexical constraints**, aligned with E.10:
1. **`*Slot` reserved for SlotKind.**
   * Any Tech name ending with `…Slot` **MUST** denote a SlotKind: a named place in a relation/morphism signature.
   * Examples:
     – `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`.
   * `*Slot` **MUST NOT** appear in names of:
     – ValueKind (e.g. `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, `U.Method`),
     – RefKind (e.g. `U.EntityRef`),
     – concrete episteme fields (they may be named e.g. `describedEntityRef`, but not `describedEntitySlotField`).
1. **`*Ref` reserved for RefKind and reference fields.**
   * Any Tech name ending with `…Ref` **MUST** denote either:
     – a **RefKind** (type of references/identifiers), or
     – a **field** whose type is a RefKind (`describedEntityRef : U.EntityRef`).
   * `*Ref` **MUST NOT** appear in names of:
     – ValueKinds (e.g. `U.EntityRef` **cannot** mean “an entity”; it is a reference type),
     – SlotKinds,
     – Kinds themselves (`U.Kind`, `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`).

3. **ValueKind names carry no `*Slot`/`*Ref`.**

   * ValueKinds are named using standard FPF conventions (A/E/F, E.10), without `*Slot`/`*Ref`.
   * Examples: `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, `U.Method`, `U.ClaimGraph`, `U.ReferenceScheme`, `U.Viewpoint`, `U.View`.

4. **No “Role” as SlotKind head.**

   * In the context of relation signatures, **do not** use “Role” as the head noun for SlotKinds (to avoid conflict with `U.Role`).
   * Use “Slot” or a neutral description: e.g. `EnactorHolonSlot` (ValueKind `U.Holon`) rather than `EnactorRoleSlot`.

These rules become part of the **LEX‑BUNDLE guards** and are enforced by F.18 / name‑acceptance harnesses. 

#### 4.3 · Integration with `U.Signature` (A.6.0)

`U.Signature` already provides a generic pattern for declaring morphism/relationship signatures (SubjectKind, BaseType, Quantification, ResultKind, Vocabulary, Laws). 

`U.RelationSlotDiscipline` refines this by adding a **SlotSpec** layer:

*For each parameter position `i` in a signature*:

```text
SlotSpec_i = ⟨name: SlotKind, value: ValueKind, refMode: {ByValue | RefKind}⟩
```

* **SlotKind** — Tech name with `*Slot` suffix, plus documentation.
* **ValueKind** — a `U.Type` (often a `U.Kind` or kernel type) declaring the intensional universe of occupants.
* **refMode**:
  * `ByValue` — the actual value of ValueKind is embedded (typical for small structured values like `U.ClaimGraph` inside an episteme card).
  * `RefKind` — a **type** of references/identifiers for that ValueKind; e.g. `U.EntityRef` for `U.Entity`, `U.HolonRef` for `U.Holon`. Substitution then operates on references, not directly on the underlying values.

In practice, a `U.Signature` that follows this pattern:

* becomes **self‑documenting**: each parameter has a clear “slot vs value vs ref” story;
* supports **typed substitution**: replacing references within the same SlotKind requires only ValueKind compatibility;
* aligns with **tool signatures** in implementation languages (row‑typed records, dependently typed parameters, effect‑typed arguments). ([ACM Digital Library][1])

#### 4.4 · Typed substitution discipline

Given a relation or morphism `R` with signature Σ and SlotSpecs `{SlotSpec_i}`:

* A **substitution** at slot `i` is a change of the argument that fills SlotKind_i, within or across episteme entries.
* `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` enforces:

1. **SlotKind invariance.**
   A substitution **never** changes SlotKind — only the occupant (Value/Ref).
   – “We put a different dataset into the `DatasetSlot`.”
   – “We switch the grounding holon in `GroundingHolonSlot`.”

2. **ValueKind compatibility.**
   The new occupant **MUST** be of the same ValueKind (or a declared subkind) as `SlotSpec_i.value`; Kind‑CAL governs this (`⊑` in C.3.1–C.3.2). If a Context uses EoIClass species constraints (C.3.2), those act as additional guards but do **not** change the SlotKind.

3. **RefKind correctness.**
   If `refMode=RefKind`, the stored field is of that RefKind; substitutions operate on references, not on underlying values. Edition pinning is handled as usual by `.edition` fields in F‑patterns (F.15, etc.).

4. **By‑value vs by‑ref awareness.**
   Substitutions at by‑value slots (e.g. `ClaimGraphSlot`) are **content changes** to the episteme or relation instance; they may affect formality F or assurance lanes. Substitutions at ref slots are **re‑targetings** of describedEntity or context, and their legality is governed by A.6.2–A.6.4 and Bridge/CL rules. Tooling SHOULD surface this difference explicitly in authoring surfaces (e.g. separate “Ref” vs “embedded content” columns).

These rules give a uniform way to say:

> “You may swap component X with Y in this slot, because they share ValueKind and pass the relevant Kind/Bridge constraints.”

### 5 · Archetypal Grounding (Tell‑Show‑Show)

Following E.7, we ground the pattern in a **System** example and an **Episteme** example. 

#### 5.1 · System example — authentication pipeline signature

Consider an `AuthPipelineSpecKind` (system‑level episteme describing an authentication pipeline for a microservice). Its key slots might be:

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — “which holon the pipeline is about”
  – ValueKind: `U.Holon` (EoIClass = “UserService system”).
  – RefKind: `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `UserService#prod`).

* `AuthProviderComponentSlot` — “which authentication provider component is selected”
  – ValueKind: `U.Holon` (EoIClass = “AuthProviderSystem”).
  – RefKind: `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `Auth_OIDC`, `Auth_LDAP`).

* `ClaimGraphSlot` — “what is asserted about the pipeline”
  – ValueKind: `U.ClaimGraph`.
  – refMode: `ByValue` (ClaimGraph stored inside the episteme card).

Substitutions:

* Changing `AuthProviderComponentSlot` from `Auth_OIDC` to `Auth_LDAP`:
  – SlotKind fixed (`AuthProviderComponentSlot`).
  – ValueKind unchanged (`U.Holon`, `AuthProviderSystem ⊑ U.Holon`).
  – RefKind unchanged (`U.HolonRef`).
  – Semantically: “swap one provider holon for another in the same slot”.

* Changing `DescribedEntitySlot` from `UserService#staging` to `UserService#prod`:
  – Same SlotKind and ValueKind.
  – Different `U.HolonRef` occupant.
  – May require different grounding and assurance episteme, but the slot discipline is identical.

#### 5.2 · Episteme example — model evaluation result

Consider `ModelEvaluationResultKind` as an episteme kind:

* `DescribedEntitySlot` — the model being evaluated
  – ValueKind: `U.Method` (intensional ML model).
  – RefKind: `U.MethodRef` (id of `Model_v3`).

* `DatasetSlot` — the dataset on which it is evaluated
  – ValueKind: `U.Entity` (EoIClass = “Dataset”).
  – RefKind: `U.EntityRef` (e.g. `Dataset_A`, `Dataset_B`).

* `TargetCharacteristicSlot` — the characteristic being measured
  – ValueKind: `U.Characteristic` (`Accuracy`, `F1`, `AUROC`).
  – RefKind: `U.CharacteristicRef`.

* `GroundingHolonSlot` — evaluation environment
  – ValueKind: `U.Holon` (e.g. `EvalCluster#1`).
  – RefKind: `U.HolonRef`.

* `ClaimGraphSlot` — evaluation result graph
  – ValueKind: `U.ClaimGraph`.
  – refMode: `ByValue`; the numeric thresholds and results live inside `content : U.ClaimGraph`.

Typical moves:
* `DatasetSlot`: replace `Dataset_A` with `Dataset_B` to test generalisation.
* `TargetCharacteristicSlot`: replace `Accuracy` with `F1` to focus on class imbalance.
* `ClaimGraphSlot`: change thresholds from “`P95Latency ≤ 200 ms`” to “`≤ 150 ms`” — a **pass‑by‑value** ClaimGraph change, not a slot change.

The SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline makes these substitutions **local and explicit**: the pattern describes which moves are allowed where, and A.6.2–A.6.4 then constrain how episteme morphisms may change ClaimGraphs and references.

#### 5.3 · Didactic micro‑examples — substitution by SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind  *(informative)*

The following short examples are intended for a didactic guide or for cross‑references from A.6.0/A.6.x/C.2.1. In all of them:
* **SlotKind** names the **place in the relation** (position/cell in the tuple).
* **ValueKind** is the **kind of value** admissible at that place (what can ever sit there).
* **RefKind** is the **reference/identifier type** used in episteme when that slot is filled (absent when the slot is by‑value).
* `GroundingHolon` is **not** a separate kernel type: it is simply a `U.Holon` used as the ValueKind of `GroundingHolonSlot`.

Example names like `FurnitureSafetyDescriptionKind`, `AuthPipelineSpecKind`, `ModelEvaluationResultKind`, `IncidentRunbookSpecKind`, `ServiceSLARequirementKind` are **context‑local** kinds, not new kernel tokens.

##### (1) Mechanics — stool on a test rig

*EpistemeKind:* `FurnitureSafetyDescriptionKind`.

*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*
* `DescribedEntitySlot` — SlotKind “what this description is about”; ValueKind `U.Entity` with EoIClass ⊑ `U.Holon` (stool as a furniture holon); RefKind `U.EntityRef` (identifier of a concrete stool `S_i`).
* `GroundingHolonSlot` — SlotKind “where the test happens”; ValueKind `U.Holon` (test rig `LabRig_j`); RefKind `U.HolonRef`.
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — SlotKind for the internal content; ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue` (graph embedded in the episteme).

*Substitutions (all under the **same** SlotKinds):*
* Episteme `E₁`: `describedEntityRef = S_1`, `groundingHolonRef = LabRig_A`.
* Episteme `E₂`: `describedEntityRef = S_2`, `groundingHolonRef = LabRig_A` — **substitute another stool in the same `DescribedEntitySlot`** (different `U.EntityRef` in the same slot).
* Episteme `E₃`: `describedEntityRef = S_1`, `groundingHolonRef = LabRig_B` — **substitute another test rig in `GroundingHolonSlot`** while keeping the same object‑of‑talk.

In all three cases the SlotKinds (and ValueKinds) are stable; only the **Refs that occupy those slots** change. This matches the engineering idiom “drop another module into the same slot”.

##### (2) Microservices — switching the authentication provider

*EpistemeKind:* `AuthPipelineSpecKind` (episteme describing an authentication pipeline for a service).

*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*
* `DescribedEntitySlot` — ValueKind `U.Holon` with EoIClass = “`UserService` holon”; RefKind `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `UserService#prod`).
* `AuthProviderComponentSlot` — SlotKind “which auth provider component is used in this pipeline”; ValueKind `U.Holon` with EoIClass = “`AuthProviderSystem` holon”; RefKind `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `Auth_OIDC`, `Auth_LDAP`).
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue` (pipeline invariants and flow logic).

*Substitutions:*
* Episteme `Spec_OIDC`: `describedEntityRef = UserService#prod`, `authProviderComponentRef = Auth_OIDC`.
* Episteme `Spec_LDAP`: same `describedEntityRef = UserService#prod`, but `authProviderComponentRef = Auth_LDAP`.
Here **SlotKind is identical** (`AuthProviderComponentSlot`); ValueKind is “any auth‑provider holon”; the episteme change is purely in the **`U.HolonRef` occupant**. This illustrates substitution of one component holon for another in the same slot, without inventing a separate ontology of “component roles”.

##### (3) Data/ML — swapping dataset or target characteristic

*EpistemeKind:* `ModelEvaluationResultKind`.
*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*
* `DescribedEntitySlot` — ValueKind `U.Method` (the ML model as an intensional method); RefKind `U.MethodRef` (e.g. `Model_v3`).
* `DatasetSlot` — SlotKind “evaluation dataset”; ValueKind `U.Entity` with EoIClass = “dataset”; RefKind `U.EntityRef` (`Dataset_A`, `Dataset_B`, …).
* `TargetCharacteristicSlot` — SlotKind “which characteristic is being measured”; ValueKind `U.Characteristic` (`Accuracy`, `F1`, `AUROC`); RefKind `U.CharacteristicRef`.
* `GroundingHolonSlot` — ValueKind `U.Holon` (evaluation cluster / infra holon); RefKind `U.HolonRef`.
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue` (evaluation results and thresholds as content).
*Substitutions:*
* `Eval_1`: `describedEntityRef = Model_v3`, `datasetRef = Dataset_A`, `targetCharacteristicRef = Accuracy`, `groundingHolonRef = EvalCluster#1`.
* `Eval_2`: same model / characteristic / cluster, but `datasetRef = Dataset_B` — **substitute another dataset in `DatasetSlot` at fixed target characteristic**.
* `Eval_3`: same model and dataset, but `targetCharacteristicRef = F1` — **substitute another characteristic in `TargetCharacteristicSlot`** while keeping the rest fixed.
`TargetCharacteristicSlot` here shows `U.Characteristic` as ValueKind: the episteme changes which characteristic it is “looking at”, without changing the method or the holon; only the `U.CharacteristicRef` occupant changes.

##### (4) Operational practice — the same runbook in different operating centres

*EpistemeKind:* `IncidentRunbookSpecKind` (runbook specification for major incidents).
*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*
* `DescribedEntitySlot` — ValueKind `U.Method` (the runbook as a method, e.g. `MajorIncidentRunbook`); RefKind `U.MethodRef`.
* `GroundingHolonSlot` — SlotKind “operational environment where this runbook is validated and in force”; ValueKind `U.Holon` (NOC centre, datacentre, cloud cluster, …); RefKind `U.HolonRef`.
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph` (steps, invariants, assumptions of the runbook); refMode `ByValue`.

*Substitutions:*
* `Runbook_DC1`: `describedEntityRef = MajorIncidentRunbook`, `groundingHolonRef = DC1_NOC`.
* `Runbook_DC2`: same `describedEntityRef`, but `groundingHolonRef = DC2_NOC`.

Intuitively this is the case “one and the same method is specified and verified in two different operational environments”. SlotKind is the same (`GroundingHolonSlot`), ValueKind is the same (`U.Holon`); only the **`U.HolonRef` occupant** differs — a clean example of substituting one holon‑environment in the same slot, without introducing a special `GroundingHolon` type.

##### (5) SLO/SLA requirements — changing the target characteristic vs changing the threshold

*EpistemeKind:* `ServiceSLARequirementKind`.

*SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind:*
* `DescribedEntitySlot` — ValueKind `U.Holon` with EoIClass = “service”; RefKind `U.HolonRef` (e.g. `CheckoutService#prod`).
* `TargetCharacteristicSlot` — SlotKind “which service characteristic this SLA talks about”; ValueKind `U.Characteristic` (`P95Latency`, `Availability`, `ErrorRate`); RefKind `U.CharacteristicRef`.
* `ClaimGraphSlot` — ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`; refMode `ByValue`. Numeric thresholds such as `≤ 200 ms` or `≥ 99.9%` live **inside the ClaimGraph as literals**, not as RefKinds.

*Substitutions:*
* `SLA_latency_200`: `describedEntityRef = CheckoutService#prod`, `targetCharacteristicRef = P95Latency`; `ClaimGraph` contains the inequality `P95Latency ≤ 200 ms`.
* `SLA_latency_150`: same `describedEntityRef` and `targetCharacteristicRef`, but the ClaimGraph threshold is `P95Latency ≤ 150 ms`. This is a **by‑value change inside ClaimGraph**: SlotKinds and ValueKinds/RefKinds are untouched; only the embedded literal changes.
* `SLA_availability_99_9`: same `describedEntityRef`, but `targetCharacteristicRef = Availability`; ClaimGraph states `Availability ≥ 99.9%`. Here we **substitute another characteristic in `TargetCharacteristicSlot`** (different `U.CharacteristicRef`), while thresholds remain by‑value in the ClaimGraph.

This example highlights the difference between:
* changing the **target characteristic** (substituting another `U.CharacteristicRef` in `TargetCharacteristicSlot` with ValueKind `U.Characteristic`), and
* changing the **numeric threshold** **inside** `ClaimGraph` (editing literals in a by‑value slot, with no RefKind involvement).

### 6 · Bias‑Annotation
**Lenses tested and scope.** This pattern was read through all five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses (`Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`) and is intended as a **universal** discipline for n‑ary relation and morphism signatures across Parts A/B/C/E. It leans toward the `Arch` and `Onto/Epist` lenses (typed signatures, explicit kinds), but mitigates this by (a) keeping the discipline notation‑agnostic, (b) aligning with existing tooling rather than prescribing any, and (c) grounding the rules in System/Episteme examples with clear didactic intent. No domain‑specific scope limitation is claimed.

* **Typed‑language bias.**
+  The pattern leans on intuitions from typed programming languages (parameter types, records, references). This is intentional: it aligns FPF signatures with mainstream tooling and with post‑2015 typed effect/row systems. The pattern remains **notation‑agnostic** and does not commit to any specific PL or logic.

* **Slot‑first bias.**
+  We treat *slot* as the primary abstraction and discourage role‑style or object‑style naming for argument positions. This favours structural clarity over conversational metaphors (“subject/object/role”) and keeps `U.Role` free for RoleEnactment rather than param‑slots.

* **By‑value/by‑ref honesty.**
  We explicitly separate ValueKind and RefKind instead of hiding “by‑reference” behind the type system. This increases verbosity but makes reasoning about edition pinning, caching, and re‑targeting more robust, and keeps I/D/S distinctions visible inside signatures.

* **Episteme‑first describedEntity.**
  The examples and cross‑references prioritise episteme use‑cases (C.2.1, A.6.2–A.6.4) where describedEntity and retargeting are subtle. System‑only usages (e.g. method signatures) are absolutely allowed but not the driving case; they inherit the same discipline without additional obligations.


### 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A.6.5‑1 · SlotSpec for every parameter.**
Every `U.Signature` that declares an n‑ary relation or morphism **SHALL** assign to each parameter position a SlotSpec triple: `⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩`.

**CC‑A.6.5‑2 · `*Slot` discipline.**
Any Tech name ending with `…Slot` **MUST** denote a SlotKind; SlotKinds **MUST NOT** be used as ValueKinds or RefKinds.

**CC‑A.6.5‑3 · `*Ref` discipline.**
Any Tech name ending with `…Ref` **MUST** denote either a RefKind or a field whose type is a RefKind. ValueKinds and SlotKinds **MUST NOT** end in `…Ref`.

**CC‑A.6.5‑4 · ValueKind purity.**
ValueKinds **MUST** be declared without `*Slot`/`*Ref` suffixes and **MUST** be FPF types (often `U.Kind` or kernel‑level types). Any existing type whose name violates this rule must be either:
* reclassified as a RefKind, or
* renamed to drop the suffix.

**CC‑A.6.5‑5 · Episteme core SlotKinds.**
For episteme kinds (`U.EpistemeKind`), the following SlotKinds **SHALL** be used (or their documented refinements) in C.2.1 / C.2.x:

* `DescribedEntitySlot` with ValueKind `U.Entity` **or a declared subkind** (e.g. `U.Method`, `U.Holon`) via Kind‑CAL (EoIClass ⊑ `U.Entity` at species level);
* `GroundingHolonSlot` with ValueKind `U.Holon`;
* `ClaimGraphSlot` with ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph` and `ByValue` mode in the minimal core;
* `ViewpointSlot` with ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`;
* `ViewSlot` with ValueKind `U.View` (`U.EpistemeView`);
* `ReferenceSchemeSlot` with ValueKind `U.ReferenceScheme` and `ByValue` mode in the minimal core.

**CC‑A.6.5‑6 · No “Role” as SlotKind head.**
SlotKinds **MUST NOT** use “Role” as their head noun; use “Slot” with a neutral qualifier instead (e.g., `EnactorHolonSlot`). `U.Role` remains reserved for RoleEnactment patterns.

**CC‑A.6.5‑7 · Substitution checks.**
Any pattern that describes substitution or replacement of arguments **MUST** phrase its rules in terms of SlotKinds and ValueKinds (and, where relevant, RefKinds), not in terms of unstructured parameter indices or ad‑hoc labels.

**CC‑A.6.5‑8 · Cross‑pattern consistency.**
When the same conceptual position is used across patterns (e.g. “describedEntity target”, “grounding holon”, “caller system”), the **same SlotKind name** and ValueKind **SHALL** be reused, unless a documented Bridge declares a different discipline or the pattern explicitly scopes itself to a distinct calculus.

**CC‑A.6.5‑9 · Migration of legacy `…Ref`/`…Slot` usage.**
Contexts adopting this pattern **MUST** maintain a migration table for legacy types/fields whose names contain `Ref` or `Slot` but do not comply with the new discipline. Each entry shall state:
* old name and role,
* new SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind,
* whether the old name becomes an alias (deprecated) or is removed.

**CC‑A.6.5‑10 · Pattern integration.**
New or revised patterns in Part A/B/C/E that introduce n‑ary relations, morphisms, or signatures **SHALL** reference A.6.5 in their Relations section and attest that they follow SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline.

### 8 · Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Uniform language for arguments.**
  Any n‑ary relation (episteme, role, method, service, guard) can be described with the same SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind triple.

* **Safer substitutions.**
  Substitution, retargeting, and viewing laws (A.6.2–A.6.4) can be stated in terms of *which SlotKinds* they read/write and *which ValueKinds* they preserve or retarget.

* **Cleaner naming and migration.**
  Misuses of `*Ref`, `*Slot`, “Role”, “Subject”, “Object” in signatures become guard‑detectable; migration strategies can be described as re‑factoring SlotKinds and ValueKinds rather than ad‑hoc renames.

* **Tool alignment.**
  Implementation languages with **row‑typed records, dependent types, and algebraic effects** map naturally to the SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind layers, easing code generation and static analysis. ([ACM Digital Library][1])

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Extra metadata in signatures.**
  Every parameter now has three pieces of information instead of one. Mitigation: template support in authoring tools; pattern‑guided macros for common shapes (episteme, role, method, service).

* **Stricter lexical rules.**
  Some legacy names will need migration (`EpistemicObject`, ad‑hoc `…Ref` types). Mitigation: migration notes in F.18 and dedicated anti‑pattern sections; transitional aliases allowed but marked deprecated.

* **Learning curve.**
  Authors must learn to think “SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind” before writing `id` or `subject`. Mitigation: Tell‑Show‑Show examples and a didactic micro‑guide on slots and describedEntity referenced from A.6.0/C.2.1/E.17.0.

### 9 · Rationale

**Why a SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind triple at all.** At architheory level, this pattern makes `U.Signature` behave like a lightweight dependently‑typed record discipline: SlotKind plays the role of an index or label, ValueKind is the family of admissible occupants at that position, and RefKind captures the representation choice (by‑value or via a handle). This mirrors the way post‑2015 work on row‑polymorphic data and effect rows treats labels and field kinds as first‑class, while keeping the Core notation‑neutral.

**Why separate ValueKind from RefKind.** In practice, “Ref” types tend to be quietly used as if they were values, eroding the I/D/S split and making edition discipline invisible. By insisting that ValueKind is always the conceptual kind (“what sort of thing is this about?”) and RefKind is always the reference/identifier kind (“how do we point at it in Episteme?”), the pattern aligns with E.10.D2’s intension/description/specification discipline and with modern resource‑aware logics that keep values and resources distinct.

**Why standardise episteme SlotKinds.** describedEntity and grounding recur across epistemes; standard SlotKinds (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, etc.) let A.6.2–A.6.4 and C.2.1 talk about substitutions and retargetings once, instead of re‑defining “what this is about” in every pattern. This is the same move that SoTA specification frameworks make when they stabilise their core judgement forms and then vary only instances and laws.

**Why lexical rules (`*Slot`, `*Ref`, no “Role” heads).** The triple only buys safety if authors and tools can see it at a glance. Reserving `*Slot` for SlotKinds and `*Ref` for RefKinds/fields gives a cheap, syntax‑level guard against conflating places, kinds, and handles. Banning “Role” as a SlotKind head prevents clash with `U.Role` and the RoleEnactment calculus, preserving the clean separation between “mask worn by a system” and “position in a relation”.

### 10 · SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

**Purpose.** To situate SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline with respect to contemporary typed and relational approaches, without importing any external calculus into the Core. All items are used as conceptual comparators; concrete reuse in a `U.BoundedContext` would happen only via explicit Bridges (F.9) with declared CL penalties.

1. **Row‑typed, extensible data / effect rows (adopt/adapt).**  
   Post‑2015 work on row polymorphism and extensible data/effect rows treats records and variants as labelled collections of fields whose presence and type can evolve independently.   
   **Adopted:** the idea that **positions** (labels) are first‑class and carry their own typing discipline.  
   **Adapted:** instead of row kinds, FPF uses SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind triples for n‑ary relations and epistemic slots; the pattern is notation‑agnostic and applies equally to episteme structures, role relations, and service signatures. ([1])

2. **Dependent type systems engineered via macros (adopt/adapt).**  
   Macro‑based dependent type systems such as Turnstile+ separate structural indices, value‑level types, and evidence, while allowing them to be related by construction.   
   **Adopted:** the separation between **indices/labels** and **values**, and the intuition that signatures should expose both explicitly.  
   **Adapted:** SlotKind corresponds to a structural index, ValueKind to the ordinary type of occupants, and RefKind to runtime‑level identifiers; the discipline is phrased at the architheory level and kept independent of any particular PL.

3. **Relational models of types‑and‑effects (adapt).**  
   Relational models for types‑and‑effects distinguish value positions from effect/resource annotations and track substitution separately across these layers.   
   **Adopted:** the insistence that reasoning about **substitution and equality** must be stratified (values vs additional structure).  
   **Adapted:** A.6.5 stratifies *slot / value / reference* instead of *value / effect*, and applies the discipline not only to programs but also to epistemes, roles, methods, and services. ([3])

4. **Optics / lenses as disciplined projections (echo).**  
   Profunctor optics formalise get/put pairs where a fixed “focus” position within a larger structure is manipulated under composition laws.   
   **Echoed:** SlotKind plays the role of the focus coordinate; ValueKind is the focus type; RefKind determines whether the focus is stored by value or via a handle. This perspective informs later use of SlotKind discipline in EpistemicViewing (A.6.3) and multi‑view publication (E.17). ([4])

**Cross‑Context reuse and Bridges.** When a `U.BoundedContext` chooses to adopt a concrete row‑typing discipline, relational logic, or optics library, it **SHALL** do so via explicit Bridges (F.9) with CL and (for plane crossings) `Φ(CL)`/`Φ_plane` policy‑ids, keeping numerical policies and notations Context‑local. A.6.5 only constrains the **slot discipline** that such Bridges must respect.

Overall, `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` echoes post‑2015 typed and relational work — *labelled positions, explicit kinds, layered references* — while staying notation‑neutral and tuned to FPF’s holonic and epistemic ontology.

### 11 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on A.6.0 `U.Signature`.**  
Refines parameter declarations with SlotSpec triples `⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode⟩` while leaving the rest of the signature structure (SubjectKind, BaseType, Quantification, ResultKind, Laws) unchanged. SlotKinds become the canonical labels for argument positions.

**Constrains C.2.1 `U.EpistemicMediationGraph`.**  
Fixes core episteme SlotKinds (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) and their ValueKinds/`ByValue` vs Ref discipline. C.2.1 and its extensions SHALL use these SlotKinds (or documented refinements) so that episteme morphisms can be expressed uniformly over slots.

**Supports A.6.2–A.6.4 (episteme morphisms and viewing).**  
DescribedEntity‑preserving vs describedEntity‑retargeting morphisms can now be stated as constraints on which SlotKinds’ ValueKinds/RefKinds they may change. Retargeting becomes “substitution at `DescribedEntitySlot` under a Kind‑Bridge” rather than an ad‑hoc parameter tweak.

**Coordinates with B.5.* (RoleEnactment).**  
Role/assignment relations may declare SlotKinds such as `HolderHolonSlot`, `RoleSlot`, `ContextSlot`, `WindowSlot` with clear ValueKinds/RefKinds, instead of overloading “role” for both holonic roles and relation positions. This keeps `U.Role` semantics (A.2, F.6) separate from slot discipline.

**Coordinates with E.17 `U.MultiViewDescribing`.**  
`Viewpoint` and `View` positions are governed by SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind; view‑changing operations can be described as substitutions at specific SlotKinds that preserve ClaimGraph content while re‑indexing viewpoints and views.

**Feeds F.18 (LEX‑BUNDLE) and E.10 (LEX).**  
Provides lexical guards for `*Slot` and `*Ref`, clarifying that:
* `*Slot` is reserved for SlotKinds only;  
* `*Ref` is reserved for RefKinds and reference fields;  
* ValueKinds and Kind names MUST NOT carry either suffix.  
Name‑acceptance and migration harnesses in Part F can detect legacy violations and drive renames.

**Used by A.19 `CharacteristicSpace` and measurement patterns.**  
+Characteristic‑space slots already behave as positions with attached kinds; slot discipline in A.6.5 gives a uniform story for how such slots appear inside relation signatures, episteme cards, and service definitions, and how substitution over those slots is checked.

## A.7 — Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)  \[A]

### 1 · Intent

Provide a **single, didactically clear lattice of distinctions** that keeps models free from category errors. This pattern is the guard‑rail that prevents four recurrent confusions:

1. **Role vs Function** (mask vs behaviour),
2. **MethodDescription vs Method vs Work** (description vs capability vs occurrence),
3. **Holon vs System vs Episteme** (what can act and what cannot),
4. **Episteme vs Carrier** (knowledge vs its material signs).

It harmonizes A.12 (External Transformer), A.13 (Agential Role & Agency Spectrum), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), and A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment).

#### 2 · Problem frame

* **Holons (A.1) and systems.** All holons are part/whole units; **only systems** can enact behaviour.
* **Externalization (A.12).** Every change is performed by a **system bearing TransformerRole** across a boundary; there is no “self‑magic”.
* **Quartet backbone (A.3, A.15).** We separate **MethodDescription** (description), **Method** (**capability under a role**), and **Work** (run‑time occurrence), with the **system bearing TransformerRole** as the acting side.
* **Evidence (A.10).** Knowledge claims are anchored via **Symbol‑Carrier Register (SCR)**; epistemes never “act”, they are **used** by systems that act on their **carriers**.

Manager’s reading: if a sentence could be read as “the document decided” or “the process executed itself”, it violates A.7.

### 3 · Problem

When documents blur the above lines, three classes of defects appear:

1. **Category collapse.** People write “function/role/process” interchangeably; teams then disagree whether they are changing a plan, a capability, or reporting an actual occurrence.
2. **Agency misplacement.** Epistemes (documents, models) are treated as doers; collectives as raw sets; or a “holon” is used where **only a system** makes sense.
3. **Audit failures.** A MethodDescription is cited as if it were evidence; or Work has no anchors (no carriers, no time span), making trust impossible (B.3).

### 4 · Forces

| Force                                        | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Didactic brevity vs conceptual precision** | Teams want short words (“process”, “function”) ↔ the framework must keep five distinct layers apart.                                || **Universality vs domain idioms**            | We support engineering idioms (procedure, SOP, algorithm, workflow) ↔ internally we must map them unambiguously.                    |
| **Parsimony vs completeness**                | Minimal concept set ↔ enough distinctions to avoid the classic traps (role/function; plan/capability/occurrence; episteme/carrier). |

### 5 · Solution — The **Clarity Lattice** (normative distinctions & safe vocabulary)

#### 5.1 **Terminology (normative): orthogonal characteristics**
• **senseFamily** — the categorical characteristic, used by F.7/F.8/F.9: {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. Rows must be **sense‑uniform**. 
• **ReferencePlane** — the referent mode per CHR: {world/external | conceptual | epistemic}. 
• **I/D/S layer** — the Intension/Description/Specification layer (E.10.D2). Not an I/D/S “plane” or "stance", and not a bare "layer".
• **DesignRunTag** — the design vs run DesignRunTag. Not a temporal “plane” or "layer", and not a bare "stance".
• **PublicationSurface** — the *didactic projection* of a Description/Specification into a **bundle of views** (ISO 42010 sense). **Surfaces are not the thing described**. Under L‑SURF, Core allows only **PublicationSurface** and **InteropSurface** tokens; faces SHALL be named **…View / …Card / …Lane** rather than inventing new `…Surface` kinds. The canonical didactic set for `[A]` is:
  {**PlainView** (explanatory prose), **TechCard** (typed cards/IDs), **NormsCard** (TechCard profile for checklists/SHALL‑clauses), **AssuranceLane** (evidence bindings/lanes)}. *Surfaces are orthogonal to I/D/S and to design/run.*
• **Typed describing/formalising morphisms (I→D, D→S)** — total morphisms that *project* along I/D/S (they are **not** mechanisms):
  `Describe_ID : I → D` (describe an intensional object into the world of descriptions; historical alias `Publ_ID`) and
  `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS : D → S` (refine a description into a specification). Composition `Describe_IS := Specify_DS ∘ Describe_ID : I → S` is allowed but both stages MUST remain visible and auditable.
  **Laws (normative):** (ID‑1) *Non‑extensibility of content*; (ID‑2) *Identity & meaning‑preserving composition*; (DS‑1) *Monotonic refinement* under ≤₍ref₎; (DS‑2) *Pin editions & measurable anchors* per **MM‑CHR** (C.16) via **CHR‑Pins**; (DS‑3) *No retro‑effects*.

A.7 establishes the following **pairs and triplets**. Use their **names** and **scope** exactly as below.

#### 5.2 Role vs Function (behaviour)

* **Role (role‑object, mask).** A contextual **position** a holon can bear (A.2, A.15). A role is **not behaviour**; it is the **mask** under which behaviour may be enacted. Example: **Cooling‑CirculatorRole** in a thermal loop.
* **Function = behaviour = Method under a role.** What a **system** actually does **when bearing a role**. In Transformer context, this behaviour is the **Method** (design‑time capability) that can be executed as **Work** (run‑time).

  * Safe rewrite for earlier “Holonic Duality (Substance ⧧ Function)”: **Holonic Duality (Substance ⧧ Role).** A `U.System` keeps its identity (substance) while **switching roles**; each role may entail a **Method** (behaviour) and its possible **Work** (occurrence).

**Normative guard:** Use “**Role**” for the mask; use “**Method/Work**” for behaviour/occurrence. Do **not** call the role itself a function.

#### 5.3 MethodDescription vs Method vs Work (design vs capability vs occurrence)

* **MethodDescription** — the **description** (algorithm / SOP / recipe / script) at design‑time. Anchored via **SCR** (A.10).
* **Method** — the **order‑sensitive capability** the **system bearing TransformerRole** can enact, composed with **Γ\_method** (B.1.5). A Method is a **timeless semantic capability**; **concrete values** are **bound at `U.Work` creation**. Outside executions we **refer to it via MethodDescription** (see A.3.1 CC‑A3.1‑5/‑9; A.15 §2.2, §4.1). 
* **Work** — the **dated run‑time occurrence** (what actually happened), with resource spend (Γ\_work) and temporal coverage (Γ\_time).

**Normative guard:** Never use MethodDescription as evidence of Work; never present Method as if it had happened.

#### 5.4 Holon vs System vs Episteme (who can act)

* **System** — the only holon kind that can **bear behavioural roles** and enact **Method/Work**.
* **Episteme** — **cannot act**; it is **changed via its carriers** by a system. Epistemes **may bear non‑behavioural roles** (e.g., **ReferenceRole**, **ConstraintSourceRole**).
* **Holon** — umbrella term; **do not** use it where only **system** is meaningful (e.g., “holon bearing TransformerRole” is **invalid**; write “**system bearing TransformerRole**”).

**Normative guard:** Behavioural roles (including TransformerRole) have **domain = system**. Epistemes may bear purely **classificatory** roles only.

#### 5.5 Episteme vs Symbol Carrier (SCR/RSCR)

* **Episteme** — the knowledge content (claim, model, requirement set).
* **Symbol Carrier** — the physical/digital sign that carries the episteme (file, volume, dataset item), tracked in **SCR**; remote sets in **RSCR**.
* **Use:** Evidence, provenance, and reproducibility address **carriers**; arguments and validity address **epistemes**.

**Normative guard:** When you say “we updated the spec”, detail **which carriers** changed (A.10).

#### 5.6 Collective vs Set, and MemberOf vs Component/Constituent/Portion/Phase (A.14)

* **Set / Collection (MemberOf)** — **mathematical or catalog** grouping; **no joint behaviour** implied.
* **Collective System** — a **system** with boundary and coordination Method (e.g., a team).
* **Use relations correctly:**

  * **ComponentOf** — mechanical/structural part in systems.
  * **ConstituentOf** — logical/content part in epistemes.
  * **PortionOf** — quantitative portion with conserved extensives.
  * **PhaseOf** — temporal part/state across a continuous identity.
  * **RoleBearerOf** — a **system** is the **bearer** of a **Role**.

**Normative guard:** If the grouping is expected to **act**, model a **collective system** (not a set) and provide its role and Method/Work.

#### 5.7 Operator alignment (names you MUST use)

* **Γ\_sys** — composition of **system** properties (physical/systemic).
* **Γ\_method** — composition of **Method** (order, branching).
* **Γ\_time** — composition of **Work** histories and temporal parts.
* **Γ\_work** — composition of **resource spend** and yields tied to Work. Do not track costs with Γ\_method; costs (resources/yield) belong to Γ\_work.

**Normative guard:** Avoid generic “process” for these operators. Reserve “process” for domain idioms; map internally to **Method** (design) and **Work** (run).

#### 5.8 I/D/S vs PublicationSurface (orthogonal, normative)
* **I/D/S governs the model.** What the thing *is* vs how it is *described/tested* lives in I/D/S (E.10.D2).
* **PublicationSurface governs the didactic projection.** How D/S are **presented** lives on **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** only; concrete faces SHALL be **PlainView / TechCard / InteropCard / AssuranceLane**. Cards/views are **conceptual views over D/S**, not the intensional object **and not symbol carriers**; physical/digital **carriers** stay in **SCR/RSCR** (A.10).
* **Surface field pins.** When D/S are shown on **TechCard**, pin the minimal **CHR‑Pins** = {**UnitType**, **ScaleKind**, **ReferencePlane**, **EditionId**}. 
* **Bridge routing.** Cross‑Context or cross‑plane reuse **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL**; **Φ(CL)**/**Φ_plane** penalties route to **R (trust)** only; **F/G invariant**. 

#### 5.9 Typed describing/formalising morphisms (I→D→S, normative)

**What `Describe_ID` / `Specify_DS` mean in A.7.** For any intensional object `X ∈ I`, *describing X* is the morphism application `Describe_ID(X) : D` (historical alias `Publ_ID(X)` in earlier drafts); *formalising that description* is `Specify_DS(Describe_ID(X)) : S` (alias `Formalize_DS`). The collapsed arrow `Describe_IS(X)` MAY be referenced, but **implementations SHALL expose and audit both steps**.

**Invariants (restate of the A.6.2/A.6.3 laws, audit‑oriented):**
1. **Non‑extensibility (ID‑1).** `Describe_ID` MUST NOT introduce new epistemic commitments. If a claim `c` is absent in `X`, it is absent in `Describe_ID(X)`; any added structure is representational only (formatting, indexing, cross‑references).
2. **Identity & meaning preservation (ID‑2).** If `f : X → Y` is a meaning‑preserving map in I, then `Describe_ID(f)` is defined and preserves identity, and where meaningful composition exists, `Describe_ID(f ∘ g) = Describe_ID(f) ∘ Describe_ID(g)`.
3. **Monotonic refinement (DS‑1).** If `D₁ ≤₍ref₎ D₂`, then `Specify_DS(D₁) ≤₍ref₎ Specify_DS(D₂)` (equivalently `Formalize_DS(D₁) ≤₍ref₎ Formalize_DS(D₂)`). Also `D ≤₍ref₎ Specify_DS(D)` holds when S merely adds testable structure.
4. **Pinning of editions & anchors (DS‑2).** `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS` MUST pin: **edition id**, **unit/scale types**, **ReferencePlane**, and **measurable anchors** (CG‑Spec/CHR). Pins are visible on **TechCard/NormsCard** faces and recorded in **SCR**; edition governance follows **U.EditionSeries**.
5. **No retro‑effects (DS‑3).** Applying `Specify_DS` yields a *new* `S` and *new* carriers (new SCR ids); earlier carriers remain valid in their scope; **no retro‑mutation** of prior I/D carriers.
6. **Separation from Γ.** `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` (`Publ_ID`/`Formalize_DS` in legacy text) do **not** compose with **Γ\_method**, **Γ\_time**, or **Γ\_work**; I/D/S describing/formalising is *not execution* and accrues no resource/time semantics.
7. **Ontology preservation.** Describing any object (Calculus/Signature/Mechanism/…) via `Describe_ID` does **not** change its ontology; it yields a D/S projection by A.7 rules. *Describing/formalising is not a subtype of mechanism*; publishing to surfaces is handled separately in E.17 (MVPK).

### 6 · Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show; System / Episteme)

#### 6.1 System and Episteme example
**System archetype — “Digital‑twin vs asset”.**  
*Claim:* *The twin (episteme) does not “act”; the **system** bearing TransformerRole enacts Work on the asset; evidence binds to carriers.*  
*Show:* A maintenance **MethodDescription** (tech card) lives at design‑time; a **Work** record (assurance face) lists Γ_time, Γ_work, PathId and **carrier** ids for telemetry. The twin’s update is **Work on the carrier**, not the asset; CL^plane penalties are disclosed when twin–asset crossings are analysed.

**Episteme archetype — “Peer‑review vs manuscript”.**  
*Claim:* *A review is Work by a **system** (the reviewer) **on carriers** of an episteme (the manuscript).*  
*Show:* The **MethodDescription** is the review SOP; the **Work** cites carrier ids (file/edition) and the *describedEntity* episteme; arguments/rebuttals live on epistemes; acceptance gating lives in CAL, not in CHR cards.

#### 6.2 Didactic examples

**Example 1 — Pump in a cooling loop**

* **Substance (system):** Centrifugal pump P‑12.
* **Role:** **Cooling‑CirculatorRole**.
* **MethodDescription:** “Loop Circulation v3” (**TechCard**, anchored in SCR).
* **Method:** ordered capability: start → ramp → hold → stop (Γ\_method).
* **Work:** run on 2025‑08‑09 10:00–10:45; energy ledger via Γ\_work; log via Γ\_time.
* **Safe phrasing:** *“The **system** playing **Cooling‑CirculatorRole** (via the P‑12 control unit as **Transformer**) executed the **Method** described by **MethodDescription**, producing **Work** …”*
* **What not to write:** “The pump’s function is the role” (role ≠ behaviour).

**Example 2 — Standard document cited in a design**

* **Episteme:** “Safety Standard S‑174”.
* **Carriers:** PDF (SCR id: scr://std/S‑174/2025‑07), printed volume (scr://print/S‑174/2e).
* **Role:** **ReferenceRole** in the valve selection activity.
* **System bearing TransformerRole:** design team’s selection service.
* **MethodDescription:** “Valve Selection SOP v5”.
* **Method/Work:** capability and dated selection session that **used** the standard; the episteme did **not** act.

**Example 3 — Set vs team**

* **Set (MemberOf):** {Alice, Bob, 3.14} — a collection; **no behaviour** implied.
* **Collective system (team):** boundary, coordination **Method**, supervision **Work**; can bear **AgentialRole** (A.13).
* **Safe phrasing:** *“Team T plays **Cooling‑MaintenanceRole** and executed Work W…”*

| **CC‑A7.7 (Collective vs set)**          | If a grouping is expected to **act**, it **MUST** be modelled as a **collective system** (boundary + coordination Method + Work), not as a **MemberOf** set.                                                                                                                                   | Presence of boundary, Method, Work for the group.                                                                                         |
| **CC‑A7.8 (Diagram legend)**             | When domain idioms use **“process”**, diagrams/text **MUST** map them to FPF terms on first occurrence: *process (domain) ≡ Method (design‑time) / Work (run‑time).*                                                                                                                           | Legend or parenthetical present at first use.                                                                                             |

| **CC‑A7.16 (Γ‑separation)**              |  Both I/D/S describing/formalising morphisms (`Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`) and publication‑to‑surface morphisms (MVPK) SHALL NOT carry cost/time semantics; **Γ\_method**, Γ\_time and Γ\_work belong to **Method/Work/System**, not to description/specification or publication. Any aggregate on a card must cite the Γ operator and policy.   | No ledger/time fields attached to `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` or MVPK publication steps; any “publication cost” is Work in a separate publication service.             |

### 9 · Anti‑patterns (with fixes)

1. **Role‑as‑behaviour** — calling the **role** “the function”.
   **Fix:** Name the **role** + **Method/Work** pair explicitly.

2. **Episteme‑as‑system** — “the model routed traffic”.
   **Fix:** Name the **system** (or Transformer as a system bearing AgentialRole) that used the model; list **carriers** touched.

3. **Triad everywhere** — omitting **Work** entirely.
   **Fix:** Add the Work lane: timestamps, outcomes, Γ\_time coverage.

4. **Operator blur** — using one “process operator” for everything.
   **Fix:** Choose among **Γ\_method**, **Γ\_time**, **Γ\_work**, **Γ\_sys**.

5. **Set‑as‑collective** — a MemberOf set “decides”.
   **Fix:** Model a **collective system** with coordination Method.

6. **Unanchored evidence** — citing ideas without carriers.
   **Fix:** Add **SCR/RSCR** ids; tie claims to carriers.

7. **Holon/system drift** — “holon maintains temperature”.
   **Fix:** Say **system**; reserve “holon” for neutral mereology.

8. **Function/role swap in tables** — columns labelled “Function” but entries are roles.
   **Fix:** Rename column to **Role**; add a separate **Behaviour (Method/Work)** column.

9. **Process‑word leakage** — domain “process” used as FPF operator.
   **Fix:** Add parenthetical mapping at first use (Method/Work).

10. **Carrier/episteme swap** — “we versioned the model” meaning a file was renamed.
   **Fix:** State whether the **episteme content** changed; if only a carrier was renamed, say so.

11. **Publication‑as‑mechanism** — modelling “publication” as if it were a Method/Mechanism.
   **Fix:** Separate **describing/formalising** (`Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`) from **publication** (MVPK D/S→Surface). If there is operational toil (build, render, upload), model it as **Work** by a **system** on **carriers**; do not change the ontology of the described object or the D/S episteme being surfaced.

### 10 · Consequences

| Benefit                      | Why it matters                                    | Trade‑off / Mitigation                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Category safety at scale** | Prevents silent logic bugs across holarchies.     | Slight verbosity → use local shorthand per A.12.   |
| **Trustworthy evidence**     | Work + SCR anchoring makes claims auditable.      | Requires discipline → provide checklists.          |
| **Operator determinism**     | Correct Γ‑flavour selection preserves invariants. | A bit more modelling → reusable templates.         |
| **On‑ramp for managers**     | Canonical rewrites give immediate phrasing fixes. | Team training → this pattern is the training page. |

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Category‑error firewall.** Clear separation of System/Episteme; I/D/S vs Surface orthogonality removes recurring modeling defects. | Authors must tag surfaces explicitly; mitigated by a minimal **SurfacePack** template in E.8. |
| **Audit and pedagogy align.** SCR/RSCR point to carriers; Normative face houses checklists; Plain face teaches; Tech face types. | Slight increase in pattern length; offset by predictable navigation and machine‑checkable CC. |
| **Cross‑Context safety.** Bridge+CL discipline is now visible even on surfaces. | Authors must cite CL policy‑ids; tooling can assist (ATS), but text remains notation‑independent. |

### 11 · SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

* **Digital Twins (ISO 23247, 2021→):** separates the asset (system) from its **digital representation** (episteme) and prescribes governance of twins without attributing *agency* to the twin itself — matching A.7’s “episteme ≠ actor” and carrier discipline. **Adopt.** 
* **Observability (OpenTelemetry, 2019→2025):** codifies **semantic conventions** as a *publication layer* over traces/metrics/logs; semantics live in descriptions, not exporters — echoing our **PublicationSurface** orthogonality. **Adapt** (terminology). 
* **Active Inference (2017→2024):** separates a **generative model** (episteme) from **actions** by the agent (system), with explicit perception–action cycles — mirroring A.7’s “who can act” and stance separation. **Adopt** 
* **Constructor Theory (2016→):** frames knowledge and work as **possible transformations** enacted by constructors (systems), not by informational states — reinforcing “episteme ≠ actor”. **Adopt** 
* **Quality‑Diversity (MAP‑Elites family, 2015→2024):** archives are **sets on typed spaces** (descriptions) whose **occurrences** are runs; selection returns **sets** under lawful orders — consonant with A.7 and A.15’s set‑returning discipline. **Adopt/Adapt**. 
* **Refinement‑typed specs (2016→):** modern stacks (e.g., Liquid Haskell, Dafny’s post‑2017 refinements, Rust’s `uom` type‑level units) treat formalization as **monotonic refinement with pinned units/scales** — echoing **Formalize_DS** and **Surface field pins**. **Adapt** (terminology; pinning discipline).

### 12 · Rationale (informal)

* **Engineering cognition:** Large programmes fail less from equations than from category slips (“process vs procedure vs execution”). A.7 eliminates these slips by a small, repeatable grammar.
* **Compatible with ISO/BORO practice:** Distinguishing artefacts (specs), capabilities (procedures), and occurrences (operations) mirrors established systems‑engineering discipline while keeping FPF’s holonic rigor.
* **Didactic primacy:** Managers can approve sentences by spotting five tokens: **system bearing TransformerRole** / **Role** / **Method** / **Work** / **SCR**.
* **Why bring “PublicationSurface” into A.7?** Strict Distinction already guards **what a thing is (I)** from **how we describe/specify it (D/S)**. In practice, **misreadings happen at the publication layer**: cards and tables are mistaken for objects; governance words leak where physics/logic should stand. By making **PublicationSurface** *explicit and orthogonal*, A.7 closes that gap without entangling semantics with any tool or notation. This preserves **C‑1 universality** and **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**, while giving E.8 a crisp home for multi‑face presentation rules.

### 13 · Relations

 **Builds on:** A.1 (Holon), A.2 (Roles), A.3 (Transformer Quartet), A.10 (Evidence & SCR), A.12 (External Transformer), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment).  
* **Constrains:** A.13 (Agency sits on systems only; epistemes non‑behavioural), Part B operators (**Γ_method**/**Γ_time**/**Γ_work**/**Γ_sys**) and their choice points; **publication is not a Γ‑operator**.  
* **Extends:** E.8 (Authoring conventions), E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE incl. **L‑SURF**), **Part F/G (UTS & CG‑Spec/CHR pinning)**, B.3 (Assurance routing), C‑cluster (selection/archives) — by enforcing I/D/S vs Surface orthogonality, System/Episteme separation, and typed I→D→S describing/formalising discipline (**publication = D/S→Surface in E.17**).  
* **Coordinates with:** ATS (E.11) for surface‑level checks (Tier/Gate/Lane/LEX) and **UTS presence** without embedding any notation dependence.
  
### 14 · Manager’s one‑page review (copy‑paste)

**Approval sentence template**

> “The **system bearing TransformerRole** ⟨name⟩ plays ⟨Role⟩; it has **Method** ⟨M⟩ (from **MethodDescription** ⟨S⟩) and executed **Work** ⟨W⟩ on ⟨time⟩, anchored to ⟨SCR ids⟩; resources accounted via **Γ\_work**.”

**Five binary checks**

1. **Actor ban:** No “actor” token; canonical phrasing present.
2. **Clear trio:** MethodDescription / Method / Work are all named (as applicable) and not conflated.
3. **Right Γ:** Γ\_method for capability; Γ\_time for occurrence; Γ\_work for resources; Γ\_sys for system properties.
4. **Episteme handled:** Epistemes do not act; carriers listed (SCR).
5. **Group clarity:** Acting group is a **collective system**, not a MemberOf set.

**Diagram legend stub**

* “process (domain)” ⇒ Method (design‑time) / Work (run‑time).
* Role column lists masks (e.g., Cooling‑CirculatorRole).
* Behaviour column shows Method/Work, not the role itself.

## A.8 Universal Core (C‑1)  \[A]

### Pattern A.8 — Universal Core Principle (C‑1) \[A]

*“A principle that works in only one world is local folklore; a first principle architects every world.”*


#### 1 · Context

FPF aspires to be an **operating system for thought** that engineers, biologists, economists, and AI agents can all use without translation layers. That promise rests on the **universality** of its core primitives (`U.Type`s).  History is littered with “upper ontologies” that proclaimed universality yet smuggled in the biases of a single discipline; once deployed beyond their birthplace, they cracked or ballooned.  Rule C‑1 turns “universal” from a marketing word into a measurable criterion: *cross‑domain congruence*.

| **Parochial Drift**       | A “universal” `U.Resource` works for ERP bills of materials but collapses for ATP in cell biology.  |
| **Alienated Communities** | Subject‑matter experts recognise the bias and abandon the framework, fracturing knowledge silos.    |

#### 4 · Solution — *The Three‑Domain Falsification Test*

> **Normative Rule (C‑1)** A `U.Type` **enters the kernel only if** it is shown to play the **same Role** in **at least three foundationally distinct domains**.

 **Heterogeneity & QD‑triad guarantee (C‑1.QD).**
 In addition to distinct **domain‑families** (choose from: *Exact Sciences · Natural Sciences · Engineering & Technology · Formal Sciences · Social & Behavioural Sciences*), the **triad** SHALL demonstrate **quality diversity**:
(a) **Hetero‑test.** Each projection adds at least one non‑trivial **DescriptorMap** signal or Bridge path not subsumed by the other two (no aliasing by mere renaming).
(b) **QD evidence.** Publish **Creativity‑CHR / NQD‑CAL** evidence for the triad: `Diversity_P` (set‑level) and its **IlluminationSummary** gauge with ≥3 non‑empty cells and `occupancyEntropy > 0` under the declared grid.
(c) **Policy disclosure.** Declare the Context‑local `QD_policy` (binning/grid, kernel, time‑window) used to compute the gauges.
(References: **C.17** `Diversity_P` & illumination gauge; **C.18** `U.DescriptorMap`, `U.IlluminationSummary`.)

Implementation steps (Domain Families): 

1. source domain‑families from the active F1‑Card (taxonomyRef/embeddingRef edition). The five coarse families {Exact, Natural & Life, Engineering & Tech, Formal, Social & Behavioural} are informative only; if used for pedagogy, publish an explicit mapping to the F1‑Card taxonomy. The triad gate is measured by MinInterFamilyDistance ≥ δ_family (per F1‑Card), not by labels alone.

2. **Role‑Projection Records** For each domain, author a short **`Role‑Projection`** tuple: `{domain, indigenous term, Role, exemplar}`.
   *Example:* `{physics, "Free Energy", extremum driver, closed gas system}`.

3. **Congruence Check** All three exemplars must satisfy the **same abstract intent**; superficial analogy is rejected.

4. **Living Index** Track the ratio

   $$
     U\text{-Index}=\frac{\text{\# kernel types lacking 3 projections}}{\text{\# kernel types}}
   $$

   as a health signal; target ≤ 0.05 (not a bureaucratic gate).

*Rule of thumb for busy managers:* “**One idea, three worlds.** If you can’t point to the trio, park it in a plug‑in.”

#### 8 · Rationale

Deep research over the last decade shows *structural homologies* across domains:

* Free‑energy minimisation ↔ negative log‑likelihood ↔ Bayesian surprise (Friston 2023).
* Conservation laws in physics mirror budget balancing in economics (Rayo 2024).

By demanding three independent manifestations, FPF captures these convergences *without privileging* any single vocabulary.  The principle operationalises **Popperian falsifiability** for universality: a concept that cannot survive a three‑domain cross‑examination is, by definition, not a first principle.  This guards Pillars **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)** and **P‑4 (Open‑Ended Kernel)** simultaneously.

#### 10 · Known Uses

* **Energy ↔ Budget ↔ Attention** – Engineering teams reused `U.Resource` to reason about battery charge, project funds, and user‑attention minutes with one algebra, cutting integration effort by half (2024 pilot).
* **Objective unification** – An AI lab mapped *loss functions*, a bio‑lab mapped *Darwinian fitness*, and a factory mapped *scrap‑rate* all to `U.Objective`, enabling shared optimisation tooling.

These cases validated that the Three‑Domain Test is achievable in practice, not theoretical paperwork.

#### 11 · Open Questions

1. **Domain taxonomy stability** – Should the five domain families be versioned as science evolves (e.g., quantum‑bio‑tech)?
2. **Automated congruence checks** – Can category‑theoretic tooling semi‑automate the functional‑role equivalence test?
3. **Edge‑case hybrids** – How are bio‑cyber‑physical chimera systems counted: a new domain or a composite projection?

## A.9 Cross‑Scale Consistency (C‑3) \[A]

> *“The logic of a bolt must still be the logic of the bridge.”*

#### 1 · Context

FPF models reality as a **nested holarchy**: parts → assemblies → systems → supra‑systems; axioms → lemmas → theorems → paradigms. Designers and analysts must zoom freely without logical whiplash. Classical mereology and modern renormalisation theory both warn: if rules mutate across scales, predictions and audits collapse. FPF therefore mandates a single, scale‑invariant Standard.

#### 4 · Solution — Invariant Quintet + Meta‑Holon Transition

##### 4.1 Invariant Quintet

Any aggregation operator `Γ` that claims FPF conformance **MUST** preserve these five invariants :

| Code     | Invariant             | One‑line Intuition                               |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **IDEM** | *Idempotence*         | Folding a singleton changes nothing.             |
| **COMM** | *Local Commutativity* | Order of independent folds is irrelevant.        |
| **LOC**  | *Locality*            | Worker or partition choice cannot affect result. |
| **WLNK** | *Weakest‑Link Bound*  | Whole never outperforms its frailest part.       |
| **MONO** | *Monotonicity*        | Improving a part cannot worsen the whole.        |

*Mnemonic:* **S‑O‑L‑I‑D** (Same · Order‑free · Location‑free · Inferior cap · Don’t‑regress).

**Inter‑Layer Standard note**
When holons are composed as a Layered‑Control stack, each Planner ↔ Regulator pair MUST publish an inter‑layer Standard: {referenceSignal, guaranteedTrackingError, cycleTime}.  Matni 2024 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15185) prove such Standards satisfy COMM + LOC invariants, giving a constructive instance of the Quintet.

##### 4.2 Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)

If empirical data show a true violation (e.g., redundancy raises WLNK limit), the modeller **declares an MHT**: the collection becomes a new holon tier, and the quintet applies anew at that scale .

| **Visible risk floor**       | WLNK blocks “averaging away” critical weaknesses.                | Can look overly conservative; redundancy, when real, lifts the minimum honestly. |
| **Parallel progress**        | COMM + LOC allow distributed teams to integrate without re‑work. | Needs explicit independence assumptions; templates guide authors.                |
| **Objective emergence flag** | Quintet failure becomes a measurable R\&D signal.                | Teams must learn to document MHTs instead of ignoring anomalies.                 |

### 8 · Rationale

*Post‑2015 evidence across domains*

* **Physics** ‑ Renormalisation coherence echoes IDEM, COMM, LOC.
* **Distributed data platforms** rely on COMM + LOC for deterministic aggregations.
* **Safety engineering** ‑ Fault‑tree analyses hinge on WLNK; aviation failures (2018‑24) confirm its necessity.
* **Lean improvement** ‑ MONO underpins Kaizen: fix a bottleneck, never worsen the plant.

Packaging these insights as one memorisable quintet → **Cognitive Elegance** with formal bite.

### 11 · Open Questions for expert panel

1. **Order‑sensitive physics** – Should quantum‑circuit folds live in a plug‑in with a relaxed invariant set?
2. **Synergistic redundancy** – Can WLNK be reframed using an “effective minimum” when true redundancy lifts the floor?
3. **Didactic tooling** – Which visual cues best alert non‑formal audiences to an approaching Meta‑Holon Transition?
4. **Layer depth** — In an LCA (layered control architectures, https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15185) stack every Planner is external to its Regulator; should FPF limit the number of nested layers, or is indefinite chaining acceptable?


###  A.10 — Evidence Graph Referring (C‑4) \[A]

*“A claim without a chain is only an opinion.”*

#### 1 · Context

FPF is a holonic framework: wholes are built from parts (A.1, A.14), and reasoning travels across scales via Γ‑flavours (B.1). To keep this reasoning honest and reproducible, every **published assertion** must be *anchored* in concrete **symbol carriers** and **well‑typed transformations** performed by an **external TransformerRole** (A.12, A.15). **Publication** itself is the typed projection **I→D→S** (`Publ_ID`, `Formalize_DS`) per A.7 and is **not execution**; any physical/digital release, rendering, or upload is **Work** by an external transformer **on carriers**, cited in SCR.

Managers can read this as a simple rule of thumb:
> **Claim → (Proof or Test) → Confidence badge**
> …where the proof/test is traceable to real carriers and to an external system/Transformer who executed an agreed method.

This pattern defines the **Evidence Graph Referring Standard** common to all Γ‑flavours (Γ\_sys — formerly Γ\_core, Γ\_epist, Γ\_method, Γ\_time, Γ\_work) and clarifies:
(a) the difference between **mereology** (part‑whole; builds holarchies) and **provenance** (why a claim is admissible; does *not* build holarchies);
(b) the run‑time / design‑time separation (A.4) across **Role–Method–Work** (A.15).

---

#### 2 · Problem

Without a uniform anchor, models drift into five failure modes:

1. **Weightless claims.** Metrics or arguments appear in the model with no link to their **symbol carriers** (files, datasets, lab notebooks, figures).
2. **Collapsed scopes.** Design‑time method specs are silently mixed with run‑time traces; results cannot be reproduced because “what was planned” and “what actually ran” are conflated.
3. **Self‑justifying loops.** A holon attempts to evidence itself (violates A.12 externality), producing cyclic provenance and unverifiable conclusions.
4. **Source loss during aggregation.** As Γ combines parts, some sources “fall out”; later audit cannot reconstruct why a compound claim was accepted.
5. **Temporal ambiguity.** Time‑series are aggregated without interval coverage or dating source; gaps/overlaps invalidate comparisons and trend claims.

The business effect is predictable: confidence badges cannot be defended, cross‑scale consistency (A.9) is broken, and iteration slows because every review re‑litigates “where did this come from?”.

| **Rigor vs. flow**              | Formal proofs and controlled tests raise confidence ↔ Engineering cadence needs lightweight, incremental anchors.                                 |

#### 4 · Solution — The Evidence Graph Referring Standard

The Standard is a small set of primitives applied uniformly, with **manager‑first clarity** and **formal hooks** for proof obligations.

**4.1 EPV‑DAG (Evidence–Provenance DAG).**
A **typed, acyclic** graph disjoint from mereology. Node types: **SymbolCarrier** (a `U.System` in **CarrierRole**, A.15), **TransformerRole** (external Transformer, A.12), **MethodDescription** (design‑time blueprint of a method, A.15), **Observation** (a dated assertion/result), **U.Episteme** (knowledge holon). Edge vocabulary is small and normative: `evidences`, `derivedFrom`, `measuredBy`, `interpretedBy`, `usedCarrier`, `happenedBefore` (temporal), etc.
*Manager view:* it is the *“because‑graph”*: every claim answers “because of these carriers, by this Transformer, using that method, then.”

**4.2 Anchors (two relations, two flavours).**

* `verifiedBy` — links a claim to **formal** evidence (proof obligations, static guarantees, model‑checking artefacts).
* `validatedBy` — links a claim to **empirical** evidence (tests, measurements, trials, observations).
  Both anchors terminate in the EPV‑DAG, not in the mereology graph.

**4.3 SCR / RSCR (Symbol Carrier Registers).**
Every `Γ_epist` aggregation **SHALL** emit an **SCR**: an exhaustive register of **symbol carriers** materially used in the aggregate, with id, type, version/date, checksum, source/conditions and optional `PortionOf` (A.14) for sub‑carriers.
Every `Γ_epist^compile` **SHALL** emit an **RSCR**: SCR specialised to a **bounded context** (vocabularies, units) with publication‑grade identifiers and hashes.
*Why this matters:* it prevents “lost sources” during composition and underwrites reproducibility without mandating any specific tool.

**4.4 Scope alignment (A.4) across Role–Method–Work (A.15).**

* **Design‑time**: **MethodDescription** lives here; methods are blueprints; anchors reference what *would* constitute proof or test.
* **Run‑time**: **Work** (actual execution) lives here; traces reference which MethodDescription they instantiate and record `happenedBefore`.
  Bridging edges are explicit (“this run trace instantiates that spec”), so scopes never silently mix.

**4.5 External TransformerRole (A.12).**
The system that produces or interprets evidence is **external** to the holon under evaluation. If true reflexivity is essential, model a **meta‑holon** (A.12): the self‑updating holon becomes the *object* of a higher‑level external transformer (the “mirror”), restoring objectivity.

**4.6 Γ‑flavour hooks (how each flavour anchors).**

* **Γ\_sys (formerly Γ\_core)**: physical properties are anchored by measurement models, boundary conditions, calibration carriers, and dated observations.
* **Γ\_epist**: always outputs SCR/RSCR; every provenance/evidence node resolves to an SCR/RSCR entry.
* **Γ\_method**: order‑sensitive composition; at design‑time a **Method Instantiation Card (MIC)** states `Precedes/Choice/Join` and guards; at run‑time traces record `happenedBefore` and point to the MethodDescription they instantiate.
* **Γ\_time**: temporal claims state interval coverage; **Monotone Coverage** (no unexplained gaps/overlaps) is required.
* **Γ\_work**: resource spending and yield are evidenced by instrumented carriers (meters, logs) and their MethodDescriptions; keep **resource rosters** separate from SCR/RSCR.

> **Manager’s shortcut:** If you can answer *what carriers, which system, which method, when*, the anchor is likely sufficient; if any of the four is missing, it is not.

#### 8 · Rationale (SoTA alignment, reader‑friendly)

* **Metrology & assurance.** The requirement to name quantities, units, uncertainty, calibration carriers reflects long‑standing metrology practice and modern assurance cases: numbers are only comparable when their **measurement models** are stated.
* **Knowledge provenance.** The EPV‑DAG and SCR/RSCR embody post‑2015 best practices in provenance for knowledge artefacts: keep a complete, machine‑checkable trail from claims to carriers; separate provenance from part‑whole.
* **Temporal reasoning.** Monotone coverage (no unexplained gaps/overlaps) aligns with temporal knowledge graph practice and avoids “impossible histories.”
* **Holonic parsimony.** By drawing a firewall between **mereology** (A.14) and **provenance**, A.10 prevents semantic leakage and keeps the holarchy well‑typed.
* **Role–Method–Work clarity.** Anchoring explicitly rides on A.15: **roles** act via **methods** specified at design‑time and produce **work** observed at run‑time. This keeps agency, policy, and execution disentangled yet connected.

Apply these text edits **only** in the holonic working file:

1. **Terminology**

   * `manifest` → **“Symbol Carrier Register (SCR)”**; `release manifest` → **“Release SCR (RSCR)”**.
   * `creator` / `observer` (as internal evidencer) → **`TransformerRole (external)`**.
   * “symbol register” (ambiguous) → **“Symbol Carrier Register (SCR)”**.
   * Keep **resource rosters** in `Γ_work` separate from SCR/RSCR.

2. **Γ naming**

   * `Γ_core` (legacy) → **`Γ_sys`** everywhere (note once: *formerly Γ\_core*).

3. **Boilerplate inserts**

   * In **A.10** (this pattern): retain definitions of **EPV‑DAG**, **SCR/RSCR**, and the flavour‑specific anchors.
   * In **B.1.3 (`Γ_epist`)**: add the **Obligations — SCR/RSCR** block (“`Γ_epist^synth` SHALL output SCR… `Γ_epist^compile` SHALL output RSCR…”).
   * In **B.1.5 (`Γ_method`)**: ensure **MIC** is referenced (Precedes/Choice/Join, guards, exceptions) and run‑time traces reference the **MethodDescription** they instantiate.
   * In **B.1.6 (`Γ_work`)**: say “resource rosters are not SCR/RSCR; anchor meter/log readings via EPV‑DAG.”


### Pattern A.11 — Ontological Parsimony (C‑5) \[A]

*“Add only what you cannot subtract.”*


#### 1 · Context

The FPF kernel aspires to remain **small enough to learn in a week** yet **broad enough** to model engines, proofs and budgets alike. Unchecked growth of primitives—well‑known from earlier “enterprise ontologies”—bloats diagrams, stalls tooling and intimidates new adopters. C‑5 therefore demands *minimal‑sufficiency*: a new core concept enters the kernel **only** when all routes of composition, refinement or role‑projection fail to express it without semantic loss.

**Lifecycle — Sunset Timer**
A cleared type enters the kernel **provisionally** with a timer (default = 4 quarters). If usage count remains zero at expiry, the type faces *Sunset Review*: delete, demote to plug‑in, or renew with fresh evidence.

### **Pattern A.12 — External Transformer & Reflexive Split \[A]**

#### 1 · Intent & Context

The principle of causality is the bedrock of engineering and scientific reasoning: every change has a cause. In FPF, this translates to a strict architectural rule: **no "self-magic."** An action cannot happen without an actor. This pattern establishes the formal mechanism for modeling causality, ensuring that every transformation is attributed to an explicit, external agent.

This pattern operationalizes the **Agent Externalization Principle (C-2)**. It builds directly upon:
*   **A.3 (Transformer Constitution):** Which defines the core quartet of action: the `Agent` (who acts), the `MethodDescription` (the recipe), the `Method` (the capability), and the `Work` (the event).
*   **A.2 (Contextual Role Assignment):** Which provides the universal syntax `Holder#Role:Context` for defining agents.

The intent of this pattern is twofold:
1.  To mandate that every transformation is modeled as an interaction between a distinct **Agent** (playing a `TransformerRole`) and a distinct **Target** across a defined **Boundary**.
2.  To provide a rigorous pattern, the **Reflexive Split**, for modeling systems that appear to act upon themselves (e.g., self-calibration, self-repair) without violating the principle of external causality.

#### 2 · Problem

Without a strict rule of agent externalization, models become ambiguous and untraceable, leading to critical failures in design and audit:

1.  **Causality Collapse ("Self-Magic"):** Phrases like "the system configures itself" or "the document updates itself" create a causal black hole. It becomes impossible to answer the question, "What *caused* this change?" This makes debugging, root cause analysis, and assigning responsibility impossible.
2.  **Audit Dead-Ends:** An auditor tracing a change finds that the system is its own justification. There is no external evidence, no log from an independent actor, and therefore, no way to verify the integrity of the transformation. This is a direct violation of **Evidence Graph Referring (A.10)**.
3.  **Hidden Dependencies:** In a "self-healing" system, the healing mechanism (the regulator) and the operational part (the regulated) are modeled as a single monolithic block. This hides the critical internal dependency between them. A failure in the regulator might go unnoticed until the entire system collapses, because its role was never made explicit.

#### 3 · Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Causal Clarity vs. Modeling Simplicity** | The need to explicitly model every cause-and-effect link vs. the desire to keep diagrams simple by representing self-regulating systems as single blocks. |
| **Objectivity vs. Internal States** | The need for an external, objective observer/actor to ground all claims vs. the reality that many systems have internal feedback loops that control their own state. |
| **Accountability vs. Automation** | In fully automated systems, it can be tempting to say "the system did it," but for assurance and safety, we must always be able to trace an action back to a specific, responsible component. |

#### 4. Solution

The solution is a two-part architectural mandate: **(1)** all transformations must be modeled with an external agent, and **(2)** apparent self-transformation must be modeled using the **Reflexive Split**.

#### 4.1 The Principle of the External Transformer

Every transformation in FPF is a `U.Work` event that is the result of an **Agent** acting upon a **Target**.

*   **The Agent:** The agent is a **Contextual Role Assignment** of the form `System#TransformerRole:Context`. This is the cause, the "doer."
*   **The Target:** The target is the `U.Holon` being changed. This can be another `U.System` or the **symbol carrier** of a `U.Episteme`.
*   **The Boundary:** The agent and the target are always separated by a `U.Boundary` and interact through a `U.Interaction`.

**Crucial Rule:** The `holder` of the Agent's `U.RoleAssignment` **cannot** be the same holon instance as the Target.
> `holder(Agent) ≠ Target`

This simple inequality is the core of the externalization principle. It constitutionally forbids self-magic.

##### 4.1.1 Reflexivity vs cross‑reference (normative note)

FPF distinguishes **reflexive transformation** from **episteme‑level reference**.  
*Reflexive* cases (e.g., “self‑calibration”) MUST be modeled by the **Reflexive Split** (Regulator→Regulated) and remain within the **world** ReferencePlane.  
When a claim **refers to** another claim/episteme, model it with **epistemeAbout(x,y)** and set **ReferencePlane(x)=episteme**. Such references **do not perform transformations** and **MUST NOT** be used to bypass the external‑agent rule. Evaluation of chains of episteme‑about relations MUST remain **acyclic within a single evaluation chain**; otherwise, abstain and request a split or external evidence.


#### 4.2 The Reflexive Split Pattern

So, how do we model a system that *does* act on itself, like a self-calibrating sensor? We use the **Reflexive Split**. We recognize that the system is not a monolith; it contains at least two distinct functional parts.

**The Procedure:**

1.  **Identify the Roles:** Decompose the system's function into two distinct roles: the part that *regulates* and the part that *is regulated*.
2.  **Model as Two Holons:** Model these two parts as two distinct (though possibly tightly coupled) `U.System` holons, even if they share the same physical casing.
3.  **Define the Internal Boundary:** Model the interface between them as an internal `U.Boundary` with a defined `U.Interaction` (e.g., a data bus, a mechanical linkage).
4.  **Assign the Transformer Role:** The regulating part becomes the `holder` of the `TransformerRole`. The regulated part becomes the `Target`.

Now, the "self-action" is modeled as a standard, external transformation that just happens to occur *inside* the larger system's boundary. Causality is restored, and the model becomes auditable.

**Didactic Note for Engineers & Managers: The "Two Hats" Analogy**

Think of the Reflexive Split like a manager who needs to review their own work. To do it properly, they must metaphorically wear "two hats."
*   **Hat 1: The Doer.** They perform the task.
*   **Hat 2: The Reviewer.** They step back, put on their "reviewer hat," and inspect the work *as if* it were done by someone else.

The Reflexive Split formalizes this. The "Doer" is the **Regulated** subsystem. The "Reviewer" is the **Regulator** subsystem, which plays the `TransformerRole`. By modeling them as two separate entities, we make the internal quality control loop explicit and prevent the logical error of a system magically grading its own homework.

#### 5 · Archetypal Grounding

The principle of external causality and the Reflexive Split pattern are universal. They apply equally to physical systems, epistemic artifacts, and socio-technical organizations.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Archetype** | "The robot calibrates itself." | The robot is modeled as a composite holon containing two subsystems: <br> 1. **`CalibrationController`** (`U.System`) <br> 2. **`SensorSuite`** (`U.System`) <br> They interact across an internal data bus (`U.Boundary`). | **Agent:** `CalibrationController#TransformerRole:RobotInternals` <br> **Target:** `SensorSuite` |
| **Episteme Archetype** | "The document automatically updates its cross-references." | The "document" is a system comprising: <br> 1. **`UpdateScript`** (a `U.System` that executes code) <br> 2. **`DocumentFile.xml`** (a `U.System` acting as a symbol carrier) <br> They interact via the file system (`U.Boundary`). | **Agent:** `UpdateScript#TransformerRole:DocumentSystem` <br> **Target:** `DocumentFile.xml` (the carrier of the `U.Episteme`) |
| **Socio-Technical Archetype** | "The team reviews its own performance." | The team is modeled as a collective `U.System` that enacts two roles at different times: <br> 1. **`ExecutionTeam`** (doing the sprint work) <br> 2. **`ReviewTeam`** (conducting the retrospective) <br> The "boundary" is the formal separation created by the retrospective ceremony. | **Agent:** `Team#ReviewerRole:RetrospectiveContext` <br> **Target:** The `U.Work` logs and artifacts produced by the `Team#ExecutionRole`. |

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
These examples demonstrate that there is *no such thing as self-action* in a well-formed model. Every action, even an internal one, can and must be decomposed into an external interaction between a distinct agent and a distinct target. This makes the causal chain explicit and auditable in all domains.

#### 6 · Conformance Checklist

To enforce the principles of externalization and causal clarity, all FPF models must adhere to the following normative checks.

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A12.1 (External Agent Mandate)** | Every transformation (`U.Work`) **MUST** be attributed to an Agent (`U.RoleAssignment`) whose `holder` is distinct from the target holon. | This is the core rule that forbids self-magic. It ensures every action has an identifiable, external cause. |
| **CC-A12.2 (Reflexive Split for Self-Action)** | Any narrative of "self-modification" (e.g., self-repair, self-configuration) **MUST** be modeled using the Reflexive Split pattern. | Forces the modeler to make internal control loops explicit by identifying the distinct `Regulator` (Agent) and `Regulated` (Target) subsystems. |
| **CC-A12.3 (Boundary Explicitness)** | The `U.Boundary` and `U.Interaction` between the Agent and the Target **MUST** be explicitly modeled. | Makes interfaces a first-class citizen of the model. Prevents hidden dependencies and ensures interactions are auditable. |
| **CC-A12.4 (Episteme Carrier as Target)** | When a `U.Episteme` is modified, the `Target` of the transformation **MUST** be its **symbol carrier** (`U.System`), not the `U.Episteme` itself. | Reinforces **Strict Distinction (A.7)**. Knowledge doesn't change by magic; a physical agent must act on its physical representation. |
| **CC-A12.5 (No Self-Evidence)** | The Agent that performs a transformation **cannot** be the sole source of evidence for the success or properties of that transformation. Evidence **MUST** be anchored via an independent `Observer`. | Prevents conflicts of interest in assurance. The `Transformer` does the work; a separate `Observer` (another RoleAssignment) validates it. This aligns with **A.10 (Evidence Graph Referring)**. |

#### 7 · Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Causal Traceability & Auditability:** Every change is linked to a specific agent and interaction, creating a complete and unambiguous audit trail. This is essential for root cause analysis and accountability. | **Increased Model Granularity:** The Reflexive Split requires creating more model elements than a simple monolithic block. *Mitigation:* This is not a bug, but a feature. The "extra" elements represent real, critical parts of the system's architecture that were previously hidden. FPF tooling can help manage this via views that can "collapse" a split system for high-level diagrams. |
| **Architectural Honesty:** The pattern forces designers to be explicit about internal control loops, interfaces, and dependencies, leading to more robust and well-understood system architectures. | **Requires a Shift in Thinking:** Modelers accustomed to "self-x" narratives must learn to think in terms of external interactions. *Mitigation:* The "Two Hats" analogy and clear archetypes (Section 5) serve as powerful didactic tools to facilitate this shift. |
| **Enables True Modularity:** By making interfaces explicit, the pattern supports modular design. A `Regulator` subsystem could potentially be swapped out for a different one as long as it respects the same `U.Interaction` Standard. | - |
| **Unlocks Deeper Analysis:** Once an internal control loop is made explicit, it can be formally analyzed for stability, performance, and failure modes using tools like the Supervisor-Subsystem Feedback Loop pattern (B.2.5). | - |

#### 8 · Rationale

The principle of externalization is not an arbitrary rule imposed by FPF; it is a distillation of foundational concepts from multiple rigorous disciplines.

*   **Cybernetics & Control Theory:** As Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety and modern control theory (e.g., Matni et al., 2024) demonstrate, regulation is fundamentally an **interaction across a boundary** between a controller and a plant. Conflating the two hides the causal structure and makes stability analysis impossible. The Reflexive Split is the FPF's implementation of this core cybernetic principle.
*   **Physics (Constructor Theory):** As discussed in A.3, Constructor Theory recasts physics in terms of what transformations are possible. A transformation is always performed by a "constructor" (our `Transformer`) on a substrate. The theory does not contain "self-constructing" substrates. FPF's externalist stance is fully aligned with this physical worldview.
*   **Philosophy of Science (Objectivity):** The scientific method is built on the principle of external observation and verification. A theory cannot validate itself; its predictions must be checked by an independent experiment. The `No Self-Evidence` rule (CC-A12.5) is the direct implementation of this principle in the FPF's assurance calculus.
*   **Software Engineering (Dependency Inversion):** The principle that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions, is a form of externalization. It enforces clean separation and makes systems more modular and testable. The explicit `U.Boundary` in our pattern serves the same architectural purpose as a well-defined interface in software.

By mandating externalization, FPF is not adding bureaucratic overhead. It is enforcing a set of first principles that are demonstrably essential for building complex systems that are understandable, auditable, and trustworthy.

## A.13 The Agential Role & Agency Spectrum \[A]

> *“Agency is not a kind of thing; it is a way some systems operate.”*

### 1 · Intent & Context

The concept of "agency"—the capacity of an entity to act purposefully—is central to engineering, biology, and AI, yet it remains one of the most overloaded and ambiguous terms. Without a precise, falsifiable, and substrate-neutral definition, models of autonomous systems risk descending into "self-magic," where actions have no clear cause and accountability is lost.

This pattern builds directly upon the foundations laid in the FPF Kernel to provide that definition. A.1 established that only a **`U.System`** can be the bearer (`holder`) of behavioral roles.  A.2.1 defined the universal `U.RoleAssignment` (`Holder#Role:Context`) as the canonical way to assign roles. A.3 and A.12 defined the `TransformerRole` and the principle of the external agent.

The intent of this pattern is to:
1.  Formally define **agency** not as an intrinsic *type* of holon, but as a **contextual Role Assignment**.
2.  Introduce a measurable, multi-dimensional **spectrum of agency** via a dedicated Characterization (`Agency-CHR`), moving beyond a simple binary "agent/not-agent" switch.
3.  Provide a clear, **didactic grading system** that allows engineers and managers to assess and communicate the level of autonomy of any system in a consistent, evidence-backed manner.

### 2 · Problem

If agency is treated as a monolithic, intrinsic property or a mere label, four critical failure modes emerge, undermining the rigor of FPF:

1.  **Episteme-as-Actor:** Models might incorrectly assign agency to knowledge artifacts (`U.Episteme`), leading to nonsensical claims like "the specification decided to update the system." This is a direct violation of **Strict Distinction (A.7)**.
2.  **Type Inflation:** Introducing a `U.Agent` as a new base type alongside `U.System` and `U.Episteme` would violate **Ontological Parsimony (C-5)** and create conflicts with the dynamic nature of roles. A system might act as an agent in one context and a passive component in another; a static type cannot capture this.
3.  **Unfalsifiable Claims:** Without a measurable basis, "agency" becomes a subjective label. A team might call their system an "agent" for marketing purposes, but this claim has no verifiable meaning and cannot be audited, violating **Evidence Graph Referring (A.10)**.
4.  **The Binary Trap:** A simple "agent/not-agent" classification is too coarse. It fails to distinguish between a simple thermostat, a predictive cruise control system, and a strategic, self-learning robotic swarm, even though their cognitive capabilities differ by orders of magnitude.

### 3 · Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scientific Fidelity vs. Simplicity** | Contemporary science (e.g., Active Inference) models agency as a continuous, scale-free spectrum. FPF needs to honor this rigor while providing a simple, teachable model for practitioners. |
| **Role vs. Type** | The intuition is to think of an "Agent" as a *type* of thing. FPF's architecture demands that it be modeled as a *role* to preserve dynamism and ontological hygiene. |
| **Measurement vs. Label** | Engineers and managers need a quick, intuitive label (e.g., "this is a Level 3 agent"), while formal assurance requires a detailed, multi-dimensional, evidence-backed measurement. |
| **System-only Action vs. Collective Action**| How does agency apply to groups like teams or swarms? This requires a clear link to the rule from A.1 that any *acting group* must be modeled as a `U.System`. |

### 4 · Solution

FPF's solution is threefold: it defines an Agent via `U.RoleAssignment` (A.2.1), makes agency measurable with a dedicated Characterization, and provides a didactic summary via a graded scale.

#### 4.1 The Core Definition: Agent as a Contextual Role Assignment

An **"Agent"** in FPF is not a fundamental type. It is a convenience term (a Register 1 / Register 2 label) for a specific kind of **Contextual Role Assignment (`U.RoleAssignment`)**:

> `Agent ≍ U.RoleAssignment(holder: U.System, role: U.AgentialRole, context: U.BoundedContext)`

This means an Agent is simply a **`U.System`** that is currently playing an **`AgentialRole`** within a specific **`U.BoundedContext`**.

*   **No `U.Agent` Type:** To be clear, there is **no `U.Agent` base type** in the FPF Kernel. This avoids type inflation and preserves the dynamic nature of roles.
*   **Epistemes Cannot Be Agents:** As the `holder` must be a `U.System`, this definition constitutionally forbids `U.Episteme`s from being agents, preventing the "episteme-as-actor" category error.
*   **Canonical Syntax:** The technical notation for an agent is `System#AgentialRole:Context`.

#### 4.2 The `AgentialRole` and its Specializations

*   **`U.AgentialRole`:** This is the abstract `U.Role` that grants a `U.System` the capacity for goal-directed action within a context. It is the "license to act."
*   **Specialized Roles:** More specific behavioral roles like `TransformerRole` and `ObserverRole` are considered **specializations or sub-roles** of `AgentialRole`. They describe *what kind* of agential action is being performed at a given moment.
    *   A system playing `TransformerRole` is an Agent *that is currently modifying another holon*.
    *   A system playing `ObserverRole` is an Agent *that is currently gathering information*.
    This creates a clean hierarchy: a `Transformer` is always an `Agent`, but an `Agent` is not always a `Transformer` (it could be observing, planning, or idle).

#### 4.3 Measuring Agency: The `Agency-CHR` and the Spectrum

Agency is not a binary switch; it is a multi-dimensional spectrum of capabilities. FPF models this using a dedicated architheory, **`Agency-CHR` (C.9)**, which is a **Characterization** that attaches a set of measurable properties to a `U.RoleAssignment`.

The `Agency-CHR` profile is grounded in contemporary research (e.g., Active Inference, Basal Cognition) and includes the following key characteristics. Each is measured for a specific agent in a specific context and must be backed by evidence (A.10).

1.  **Boundary Maintenance Capacity (BMC):** The ability of the system to maintain its structural and functional integrity against perturbations. *(How robust is it?)*
2.  **Predictive Horizon (PH):** The temporal or causal depth of the agent's internal model. *(How far ahead can it "see"?)*
3.  **Model Plasticity (MP):** The rate at which the agent can update its internal model (`U.GenerativeModel`) in response to prediction errors (`U.Error`). *(How quickly can it learn?)*
4.  **Policy Enactment Reliability (PER):** The probability that the agent will successfully execute its chosen `U.Method` under operational conditions. *(How reliably does it do what it decides to do?)*
5.  **Objective Complexity (OC):** A measure of the complexity of the `U.Objective` the agent can pursue, from simple set-points to abstract, multi-scale goals.

#### 4.4 The Agency Grade (Didactic Layer)

While the multi-dimensional `Agency-CHR` profile is essential for formal assurance, engineers and managers need a simpler, at-a-glance summary. The **Agency Grade** is a **non-normative, didactic** scale from 0 to 4 that synthesizes the CHR profile into an intuitive level of autonomy.

| Grade | Label | Typical `Agency-CHR` Profile (Conservative Lower Bound) | Archetypal Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **Non-Agential** | `BMC ≈ 0`, `PH ≈ 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A rock, a document, a passive structural component. |
| **1** | **Reactive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH ≈ 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A thermostat; a simple feedback controller. Follows fixed rules. |
| **2** | **Predictive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH > 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A model-predictive controller with a fixed model; a chess engine that plans moves but doesn't learn new strategies. |
| **3** | **Adaptive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH > 0`, `MP > 0` | A self-calibrating sensor system; a machine learning agent that updates its model with new data. |
| **4** | **Reflective/Strategic** | High `BMC`, `PH`, `MP`, `PER`, and `OC`. Capable of meta-cognition (reasoning about its own reasoning) and pursuing abstract goals. | An autonomous R&D system; a cohesive, self-organizing DevOps team. |

**Crucial Distinction:** The `Agency-CHR` profile is the **normative evidence**. The Grade is a **pedagogical shortcut**. An artifact cannot claim a grade without having a corresponding, auditable CHR profile to back it up.

#### 5 · Archetypal Grounding

The universal pattern of agency, defined as a `Contextual Role Assignment` and measured by the `Agency-CHR`, manifests across all domains. The following table demonstrates its application to the FPF's two primary archetypes: a `U.System` and a collective `U.System` (a team), while explicitly showing why a `U.Episteme` cannot be an agent.

| Archetype | Holder (`U.System`) | Role & Context (`#Role:Context`) | `Agency-CHR` Profile Sketch | Resulting Agency Grade |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple Controller** | `Thermostat_Model_T800` | `#AgentialRole:HomeHeatingSystem` | `BMC`: High (maintains temp). <br> `PH`: Zero (no prediction). <br> `MP`: Zero (fixed logic). <br> `PER`: Very High. <br> `OC`: Low (single set-point). | **Grade 1 (Reactive)** |
| **Advanced Controller** | `PredictiveCruiseControl_v3` | `#AgentialRole:VehicleDynamics` | `BMC`: High. <br> `PH`: High (predicts traffic flow). <br> `MP`: Zero (fixed model). <br> `PER`: High. <br> `OC`: Medium (optimization). | **Grade 2 (Predictive)** |
| **Learning System** | `SelfCalibratingSensorArray` | `#AgentialRole:IndustrialProcess` | `BMC`: High. <br> `PH`: High. <br> `MP`: Medium (learns drift). <br> `PER`: High. <br> `OC`: Medium. | **Grade 3 (Adaptive)** |
| **Collective Agent** | `DevOpsTeam_Phoenix` (a collective `U.System`) | `#AgentialRole:ProjectPhoenix` | `BMC`: High (maintains velocity). <br> `PH`: High (sprint planning). <br> `MP`: High (retrospectives). <br> `PER`: Medium-High. <br> `OC`: High (abstract business goals). | **Grade 4 (Reflective/Strategic)** |
| **Knowledge Artifact** | `ISO_26262_Standard.pdf` (`U.Episteme`) | **N/A** (Cannot be a holder of an `AgentialRole`) | N/A | **Grade 0 (Non-Agential)** |

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
This table makes the abstract model concrete. It shows that the FPF agency model can precisely differentiate between simple controllers and complex learning systems. It also reinforces the **Strict Distinction** principle: the ISO standard (`U.Episteme`) is a crucial **justification (`justification?`)** for the actions of an agent (like the DevOps team), but it is never an agent itself.

#### 6 · Conformance Checklist

To ensure the agency model is applied rigorously and consistently, all FPF artifacts must adhere to the following normative checks.

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A13.1 (Holder Type)** | The `holder` of a `U.RoleAssignment` with `role: U.AgentialRole` **MUST** be a `U.System`. | Prevents the "episteme-as-actor" category error. Enforces **Strict Distinction (A.7)**. |
| **CC-A13.2 (RoleAssignment Mandate)** | Any claim of agency **MUST** be represented by a complete `U.RoleAssignment` instance, including an explicit `holder`, `role`, and `context`. | Ensures that agency is always modeled as contextual and bound to a specific bearer, not as a free-floating property. |
| **CC-A13.3 (CHR Evidence)** | Any claim about an Agent's grade or level of autonomy **MUST** be substantiated by an auditable `Agency-CHR` profile with Evidence Graph Ref (A.10). | Makes claims of agency falsifiable and prevents "agency by marketing." |
| **CC-A13.4 (Grade is Didactic)**| The **Agency Grade (0-4)** **SHALL NOT** be used as a normative input for formal reasoning. It is a didactic summary of the `Agency-CHR` profile. | Prevents oversimplification in formal models. The detailed profile, not the summary grade, must be used for assurance cases. |
| **CC-A13.5 (Collective as System)** | To claim agency for a collective (e.g., a team, a swarm), the collective **MUST** first be modeled as a `U.System` with a defined `U.Boundary` and a coordination `U.Method`. | Prevents the error of assigning agency to a mere set or collection (`MemberOf`). Aligns with **A.1** and **A.14**. |
| **CC-A13.6 (MHT for Emergent Agency)** | If a collection of systems, previously non-agential or at a lower grade, develops a new supervisory structure and crosses a documented `Agency-CHR` threshold, a **Meta-Holon Transition (MHT, B.2)** **MUST** be declared. | Makes the emergence of collective agency an explicit, auditable event, preventing "magic" emergence. |

#### 7 · Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Category Safety & Clarity:** The pattern provides a clear, unambiguous definition of agency that prevents common modeling errors and is consistent across all of FPF. | **Increased Modeling Granularity:** Requires modelers to think in terms of Role-assignments and contexts, which is slightly more complex than just labeling something an "Agent." *Mitigation:* The `Holon#Role:Context` syntax and tooling support make this manageable in practice. |
| **Falsifiable & Measurable Agency:** By grounding agency in the `Agency-CHR`, the framework transforms a vague philosophical concept into a set of concrete, evidence-backed engineering properties. | **Measurement Effort:** Populating the `Agency-CHR` profile requires real work (testing, analysis, data gathering). *Mitigation:* The profile can be built iteratively. An initial estimate can be used, with the understanding that its `Reliability (R)` score is low until backed by evidence. |
| **Scalable Autonomy Model:** The graded scale provides a sophisticated language for describing and comparing different levels of autonomy, from simple automation to strategic intelligence. | **Risk of Misinterpreting Grades:** The simple 0-4 scale could be misused as a simplistic marketing label. *Mitigation:* The normative requirement (**CC-A13.4**) to always link a grade to its underlying CHR profile acts as a guardrail against this. |
| **Elegant Handling of Collectives:** The pattern provides a clean way to model the agency of teams, swarms, and organizations without violating ontological principles. | - |

#### 8 · Rationale

This pattern's strength comes from its synthesis of contemporary, post-2015 research into a single, operational model.

*   **Grounded in Science:** The move away from a binary, type-based view of agency towards a **graded, spectrum-based model** is directly aligned with modern research in Active Inference (Friston et al.), Basal Cognition (Fields, Levin), and evolutionary cybernetics. The `Agency-CHR` provides a direct, practical implementation of these ideas.
*   **Ontologically Sound:** By defining an Agent as a **Contextual Role Assignment**, the pattern avoids the ontological pitfalls of creating a new base type. It fully embraces the FPF's core architectural principle of separating **substance (`holder`)** from **function (`role`)** within a **context**. This aligns with best practices from foundational ontologies (like UFO) and the principles of **Strict Distinction (A.7)**.
*   **Pragmatic and Actionable:** The pattern is designed for engineers and managers. The `Agency Grade` provides a quick communication tool, while the underlying `Agency-CHR` provides the detailed, auditable data needed for formal assurance and risk management. This duality satisfies both **Didactic Primacy (P-2)** and **Pragmatic Utility (P-7)**.

In essence, this pattern does not *invent* a new theory of agency. It **distills and operationalizes** the emerging scientific consensus, packaging it into a rigorous, falsifiable, and practical tool for the FPF ecosystem.

#### 9 · Relations

*   **Builds on:**
    *   `A.1 Holonic Foundation`: Establishes that only `U.System`s can be bearers of behavioral roles.
    *   `A.2 Role Taxonomy`: Provides the universal  Contextual Role Assignment (`U.RoleAssignment`) mechanism.
    *   `A.12 External Transformer`: The actions of an Agent are modeled using the external transformer principle.

    *   `B.2 Meta-Holon Transition (MHT)`: A significant jump in the `Agency-CHR` of a collective can trigger an MHT.
    *   `B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus`: The `Agency-CHR` profile provides crucial inputs for assessing the reliability and safety of an autonomous system.
    *   `D.2 Multi-Scale Ethics Framework`: The Agency Grade is used to determine the level of moral responsibility and accountability assigned to a system.
*   **Instantiates:**

# A.14 — Advanced Mereology: Components, Portions, Aspects & Phases  \[A]


#### 1 · Context — why an advanced mereology?

FPF’s holonic world is built from **part–whole** relations. Early drafts distinguished structural vs. conceptual parthood (e.g., **ComponentOf**, **ConstituentOf**) but practical modelling kept hitting two recurrent gaps:

1. **Quantities vs. parts.** Engineers routinely need “some of the fuel”, “the first 10 pages”, “a 30% subset of data”. This is not a component; it is a **portion** of a stuff‑like whole, governed by measures and conservation.

2. **Change vs. replacement.** Authors need to say “the prototype **before calibration**”, “v2 of the spec”, “shift 1 vs. shift 2 of the same run”. That is not a new whole; it is a **phase** of the same carrier across time.

This section introduces two **normative** sub‑relations of `partOf` that close those gaps and lock them to the rest of the kernel:

* **PortionOf** — metrical, measure‑preserving parthood of stuffs and other measurables.
* **PhaseOf** — temporal parthood of the *same* carrier across an interval.

It also restates guard‑rails that keep **roles** and **recipes** outside mereology (A.15), and clarifies how **MemberOf** fits (preview: **collections** are grounded constructively in **C.13 Compose‑CAL** via `Γ_m.set`; **collective agency** is handled outside mereology in **A.15 Role–Method–Work**).

**Publication note (Working‑Model first).** Read A.14 together with **E.14 Human‑Centric Working‑Model** and **B.3.5 CT2R‑LOG**: publish relations on the **Working‑Model** surface; when assurance is sought, **ground downward**. For structural claims that require extensional identity, use the **Constructive** shoulder via **Compose‑CAL Γ_m (sum | set | slice)**; order/time stay outside mereology (Γ_time / Γ_method).

#### 2 · Problem — what breaks without these distinctions?

If we only have “generic partOf” (plus Component/Constituent), four classes of errors appear:

1. **Conservation errors.** Treating “20 L of fuel from Tank A” as a component leads to nonsense: adding and removing such “components” does not respect quantities; Γ\_sys proofs violate Σ‑balance.

2. **Temporal smearing.** Flattening “before/after”, or “v1/v2” into one timeless whole collapses history; Γ\_time and Γ\_method cannot justify order‑sensitive properties; audits cannot reproduce conditions.

3. **Identity confusion.** Modelling “new version” as “new component” either breaks identity (it is still the *same* holon evolving) or hides a **Meta‑Holon Transition** when identity really changes.

4. **Role leakage.** Functional/organisational roles sneak into part trees (“the PumpRole is part of the plant”), violating A.15 and making structural reasoning brittle.

| **Universality vs. Domain nuance** | One set of rules must serve physical systems and epistemes ↔ measurement and time behave differently by domain. |
| **Identity vs. Change**            | Preserve “the same carrier through change” ↔ allow explicit re‑identification when invariants fail.             |
| **Static structure vs. Histories** | Part trees should be simple ↔ real work requires phased histories and measured slices.                          |

#### 4 · Solution — extend the mereology catalogue, keep it clean

**A.14 defines two additional sub‑relations of `partOf`** and **re‑affirms the firewall** between mereology and the role/recipe layer:

1. **PortionOf** — for *measured* parts of a whole (stuffs and other extensives).
2. **PhaseOf** — for *temporal* parts of the same carrier.
3. **No roles/recipes in mereology.** `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription` are **never** parts (A.15).
4. **MemberOf stays, but constructive aggregation and agency live elsewhere.** `MemberOf` remains available to state collections and collectives; **their collection‑as‑whole may be constructed via Γ\_m.set (Compose‑CAL, C.13)**, while **composition and agency are handled in B.1.7 Γ\_collective** (not in A.14).

The classical pair **ComponentOf** (structural, discrete) and **ConstituentOf** (conceptual, logical/epistemic) remain as in the kernel; A.14 only clarifies **how to tell them apart from Portion/Phase** (§ 6).

#### 5 · Formal cores (normative semantics)

##### 5.1 PortionOf — metrical part of a measurable whole

**Intent.** Capture “some of the same stuff/extent”, governed by a measure that adds up.

**Applicability.** Any `U.Holon` that carries an **extensive** measure μ on the chosen scope
(examples: mass, volume, length‑of‑text, byte size, wall‑time budget).

**Primitive.** `PortionOf(x, y)` means: *x is the same kind of stuff/content as y, but less*.

**Axioms (A14‑POR‑\*)**

* **POR‑1 (Partial order).** PortionOf is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive on its domain.
* **POR‑2 (Metrical dominance).** If `x ProperPortionOf y` then `0 < μ(x) < μ(y)` for the agreed μ.
* **POR‑3 (Additivity on disjoint portions).** If `x ⟂ y` (no overlap) and both PortionOf y, then `μ(x ⊔ y) = μ(x)+μ(y)` and `x ⊔ y PortionOf y`.
* **POR‑4 (Kind integrity).** x and y must share the same **measure kind** and **unit** (or a declared conversion).
* **POR‑5 (Boundary compatibility).** For physical wholes, the whole’s boundary encloses the union of its portions; cross‑boundary “leaks” are interactions, not portions.

**Didactic tests.**
✔ “5 kg from a 20 kg billet” — PortionOf.
✔ “Pages 1–10 of the report” — PortionOf (μ = page or token count).
✘ “The pump module of the plant” — **ComponentOf**, not PortionOf.
✘ “The Methods section of the paper” — **ConstituentOf**, not PortionOf.


##### 5.2 PhaseOf — temporal part of the same carrier

**Intent.** Capture “the same holon during a sub‑interval”, preserving identity through change.

**Applicability.** Any `U.Holon` that persists across time with a recognised **carrier identity**.

**Primitive.** `PhaseOf(x, y)` means: *x is y restricted to a proper time interval*.

**Axioms (A14‑PHA‑\*)**

* **PHA‑1 (Partial order).** PhaseOf is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive (on the same carrier).
* **PHA‑2 (Coverage).** The whole is the union of its maximal, non‑overlapping phases over its lifetime interval.
* **PHA‑3 (No paradoxical overlap).** Phases of the **same carrier** do not overlap in time; overlapping variants require `PhaseOf` on *aspects* or different carriers.
* **PHA‑4 (Identity through change).** Properties may vary between phases, but the carrier’s identity criteria hold continuously (e.g., same serial number, same legal identity, same theorem statement).
* **PHA‑5 (Escalation to MHT).** If identity criteria break (e.g., metamorphosis with new objectives), **declare a Meta‑Holon Transition (B.2)** rather than a PhaseOf.

**Didactic tests.**
✔ “PumpUnit#3 **before** calibration” — PhaseOf(Pump#3\_pre, Pump#3).
✔ “Spec v2” — PhaseOf(Spec\_v2, Spec), on the **MethodDescription** artefact.
✔ “Shift 1 of the same batch run” — PhaseOf(Work\_shift1, Work).
✘ “Prototype vs. production unit” — likely **different carriers**; use ComponentOf/ConstituentOf or MHT per criteria.

##### 5.3 CT2R‑LOG & Compose‑CAL handshake *(normative link)*

* **Structural claims** published on the Working-Model surface **SHALL** be justified, when assurance is required, by a **Constructive** grounding narrative using **Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice** and **linked with `tv:groundedBy`** (see **B.3.5**; **C.13**).  
* **PhaseOf** is **temporal parthood**; it **SHALL NOT** be grounded via Γ\_m. Its assurance follows identity‑through‑time criteria (CC‑PHA‑1..3) and Γ\_time ordering (B.1.4).  
* **MemberOf** remains **non‑mereological** (CC‑MEM‑2). When modelling a collection‑as‑whole for assurance purposes, the constructive basis is **Γ\_m.set**; no **ComponentOf** inferences follow from **MemberOf**.

#### 6 · Choosing the right relation (decision table)

| You want to say…                                             | Use                  | Why                                                                                |

| “This is a *discrete part* that sits *inside* the whole.”    | **ComponentOf**      | Structural parthood; boundary‑respecting, not measured by μ.                       |

> **Firewall reminder.** If your sentence contains “role”, “policy”, “process/workflow/SOP/script”, you are likely talking about **A.15** (roles/recipes/runs), **not** A.14.

#### 8 · Conformance Checklist & type guards (normative)

##### **8.1 Global firewall and scope**

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A14‑0**  | No `U.Role`, `U.Method`, or `U.MethodDescription` **MAY** occur as a node in any `partOf` chain.   | Keeps parthood purely structural/conceptual (see A.15). |
| **CC‑A14‑0b** | `MemberOf` **MUST NOT** imply, entail, or be auto‑rewritten into any `partOf` sub‑relation. | Separates collections/collectives from parthood.        |
| **CC‑A14‑0c** | `SerialStepOf` / `ParallelFactorOf` **MUST NOT** appear in any `partOf` chain or table in A.14; model order via **A.15** (**Γ_ctx/Γ_method**). | Prevents the “order‑as‑structure” category error.       |

##### **8.2 PortionOf guards**

| ID                                 | Requirement                                                                                                                                                               | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑POR‑1 (Domain)**              | `PortionOf(x,y)` is valid only if the modelling scope declares at least one **extensive measure** μ for y (mass, volume, token count, byte size, wall‑time budget, etc.). | Prevents “portion” without a measure.   |
| **CC‑POR‑2 (Kind)**                | x and y **SHALL** share the same μ‑kind and compatible units (or an explicit conversion).                                                                                 | Prevents apples‑to‑oranges addition.    |
| **CC‑POR‑3 (Monotone additivity)** | For disjoint portions `x ⟂ z` with `PortionOf(·,y)`: μ(x ⊔ z) = μ(x)+μ(z).                                                                                                | Secures Σ‑reasoning and Γ\_sys proofs. |
| **CC‑POR‑4 (Boundary)**            | For physical systems, the whole’s boundary encloses the union of portions; cross‑boundary flows are **not** portions.                                                     | Distinguishes stock vs flow.            |
| **CC‑POR‑5 (Non‑replacement)**     | “Replacing 20% of y by v” **MUST** be modelled as **PortionOf** removal + **Component/Constituent** insertion, not as a single PortionOf rewrite.                         | Avoids silent identity change.          |

##### **8.3 PhaseOf guards**

| ID                                    | Requirement                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑PHA‑1 (Carrier identity)**       | `PhaseOf(x,y)` requires an explicit **identity criterion** for y valid over the union of phases (e.g., serial number, legal identity, theorem statement).        | Prevents re‑identification by stealth. |
| **CC‑PHA‑2 (Coverage & non‑overlap)** | The lifetime of y equals the union of its maximal, non‑overlapping phases (on the same aspect).                                                                  | Enables Γ\_time composition and audit. |
| **CC‑PHA‑3 (Aspect clarity)**         | If two temporal slices of y overlap, they **MUST** be phases of **different aspects** (e.g., mechanical‑state vs software‑state), or else be different carriers. | Avoids paradoxical overlaps.           |
| **CC‑PHA‑4 (Escalation)**             | If identity criteria fail during change, declare a **Meta‑Holon Transition** (B.2) instead of PhaseOf.                                                           | Makes re‑identification explicit.      |
| **CC‑PHA‑5 (MethodDescription & Work)**      | Versions of **MethodDescription** and slices of **Work** **SHALL** use `PhaseOf` (A.15); PhaseOf never applies to `U.Role`.                                             | Aligns with A.15 bindings.             |

##### **8.4 Anchoring & validation (normative)**

| ID              | Requirement                                                                                                      | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑ANCH‑1**   | Every `ut:StructPartOf` edge **MUST** carry a `tv:groundedBy` link to a valid `Γ_m` constructor trace (Compose‑CAL). | Makes A.10 executable; ensures extensional identity. |
| **CC-ANCH-2**   | For **epistemic** edges (`ut:EpiPartOf` and its sub-types), `tv:groundedBy` is **OPTIONAL**; instead supply **`ev:evidence`** and set **`validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, postulate, inferential}`**. | Harmonises evidence treatment for epistemic edges. |
| **CC‑ANCH‑3**   | The public query Standard remains `?x ut:PartOf+ ?y`; internally it is realised via CT2R‑aliases grounded by `Γ_m` traces. | Preserves the “one query” UX while tightening semantics. |

*Note.* Property names and trace semantics are defined in the CT2R‑LOG / Compose‑CAL architheories.

##### **8.5 MemberOf minimal semantics (non‑mereological)**

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑MEM‑1** | `MemberOf` domain/range are open: any `U.Holon` may be a member of a collection/collective holon. | Allows mixed collections when needed. |
| **CC‑MEM‑2** | From `MemberOf(x,C)` it is **forbidden** to infer any property of C to x via parthood rules.      | Prevents “set‑as‑whole” errors.       |
| **CC‑MEM‑3** | **Constructive aggregation of collections** is provided by **C.13 Compose‑CAL** (`Γ_m.set`); **agency of collectives** is specified outside A.14 (see **A.15 Role–Method–Work**). | Keeps A.14 narrow and clean.          |


##### **8.5 CT2R‑LOG handshake (Working‑Model → Assurance)**

| ID                 | Requirement                                                                                                                                                              | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC-A14-10**      | For **structural** edges on the Working-Model surface, authors **SHALL** set `validationMode=axiomatic` and attach **`tv:groundedBy → Γ_m.sum|set|slice`**.      | Aligns A.14 with CT2R-LOG (**B.3.5**) and Compose-CAL (**C.13**); ensures extensional identity. |
| **CC‑A14‑11**      | **PhaseOf** edges **SHALL NOT** use Γ\_m for grounding. Authors **SHALL** provide identity criteria and non‑overlap per **CC‑PHA‑1..3** and reference **Γ\_time** when ordering matters. | Keeps temporal parthood distinct from construction; preserves the plane firewall.       |

#### 9 · Validation patterns (author’s decision procedure)

**Step 0 — Firewall check.**
If your sentence contains *role*, *policy*, *process/workflow/SOP/script*, or *execution/run/job*, you are **not** in mereology; go to **A.15** (Role–Method–Work).

**Step 1 — Is it measured stuff?**
If yes, pick **PortionOf**. Confirm μ is declared (CC‑POR‑1/2). Test additivity on a toy split (CC‑POR‑3). If flows cross a boundary, remodel as interactions, not portions (CC‑POR‑4).

**Step 2 — Is it a discrete inside part?**
If yes, pick **ComponentOf** (physical) or **ConstituentOf** (conceptual). Do **not** use PortionOf here.

**Step 3 — Is it the same carrier at a time slice?**
If yes, pick **PhaseOf**. Verify identity criteria and non‑overlap (CC‑PHA‑1/2/3). If criteria break, escalate to **B.2** (CC‑PHA‑4).

**Step 4 — Is it a membership statement?**
Use **MemberOf** only; avoid any part‑inferences (CC‑MEM‑2). If you need a **collection as a whole**, use **C.13** (`Γ_m.set`) for constructive grounding. If you need **collective action**, defer to **A.15**.

**Quick spot‑tests (repair kit).**

| Smell                          | Likely error                      | Fix                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “20% of the chassis”           | Treating structure as stuff       | Use **ComponentOf**; if truly laminar material, PortionOf applies to **material stock**, not the assembled chassis.          |
| “Chapter 2 is 15% of the book” | Mixing measures and constituents  | Use **ConstituentOf**; the 15% is **length‑of‑text** as a separate statement.                                                |
| “Spec v2 overlaps v1”          | Overlapping phases on same aspect | Use `PhaseOf(Spec_v2, Spec)` with non‑overlap; represent drafting as **Work** episodes (A.15) rather than overlapping specs. |
| “Team is part of the project”  | Member vs part confusion          | Use **MemberOf(Team, ProjectCollective)**, not partOf.                                                                       |

#### 10 · Interplay with Γ‑flavours (how these relations behave under aggregation)

| Γ‑flavour                    | Mereological hooks (what A.14 supplies)                                                                                                                | Key effect                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Γ\_sys (B.1.2)**          | Treat **PortionOf** as Σ‑additive stocks; **ComponentOf** must respect boundary integration; **PhaseOf** is not aggregated here.                       | Conserves extensive measures and keeps structural WLNK (weakest‑link) on components.          |
| **Γ\_epist (B.1.3)**         | **PortionOf** of texts/data uses μ = token/byte count; **ConstituentOf** composes arguments/sections; **PhaseOf** versions MethodDescriptions/documents.      | Preserves provenance and avoids trust inflation by keeping constituents vs portions distinct. |
| **Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4)** | **PhaseOf** provides the legal slicing for time and order; **PortionOf** is orthogonal (quantities inside steps).                                      | Ensures chronological consistency and monotone coverage.                                      |
| **Γ\_method (B.1.5)**          | Recipes are **MethodDescription** graphs (not parthood). When a recipe refers to stuff‑like inputs, those are **PortionOf** statements on resources.          | Separates recipe composition from structure.                                                  |
| **Γ\_work (B.1.6)**          | Only **Work** carries resource deltas; when logging “consumed 5 kg from Tank A”, model it as **PortionOf** relation to the stock prior to consumption. | Makes Σ‑balance explicit; aligns with CC‑POR‑3/4.                                             |

#### 11 · Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Predictable composition.** Σ‑additivity for portions and identity‑through‑time for phases make Γ‑proofs straightforward.
* **History without confusion.** Temporal slicing is explicit and audit‑ready; no paradoxical overlaps.
* **Cleaner integration with roles and recipes.** The firewall prevents “functional object” creep into structure.
* **Compatibility with engineering practice.** Mirrors *product breakdown* (components) vs *functional breakdown* (roles) vs *material stocks* (portions) vs *versioning* (phases).

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Modelling energy.** Authors must pick μ and declare units; provide a short μ‑catalog per project.
* **More relation names.** Two extra sub‑relations increase vocabulary; mitigated by the decision table (§ 6) and spot‑tests (§ 9).
* **Escalation discipline.** Deciding PhaseOf vs MHT requires judgement; A.14 provides criteria, and B.2 captures true re‑identification.

#### 12 · Pedagogy aids (non‑normative)

**Two‑minute checklist for reviewers**

1. Do I see “process/workflow/policy/script”? — then **A.15**, not mereology.
2. Does every PortionOf have a declared μ and unit?
3. Do phases cover a lifetime without overlap for the same aspect?
4. Are any roles/recipes appearing as parts? If yes, stop and refactor.

#### 13 · Patch map (where to touch in the working file)

1. **Kernel · Holonic Mereology (§ A.1 → A.14)**
   *Add* sub‑sections “PortionOf” and “PhaseOf” with axioms (POR‑1..5, PHA‑1..5).
   *Move* MemberOf note to a minimal semantics paragraph (no composition here).

2. **A.15 (Role–Method–Work)**
   *Cross‑link* firewall (CC‑A14‑0/0b) and reinforce that versioning uses **PhaseOf** only on MethodDescription/Work.

3. **B.1.2 Γ\_sys / B.1.3 Γ\_epist / B.1.4 Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time / B.1.5 Γ\_method / B.1.6 Γ\_work**
   *Insert* a one‑line “A.14 compliance” note: which A.14 sub‑relations each flavour relies on, as in § 10.

4. **Examples & Annexes**
   *Refactor* any “percentage as part” examples into PortionOf with declared μ;
   *Split* any overlapping histories into PhaseOf sequences.

Each edited heading should carry the badge **“► decided‑by: A.14 Advanced Mereology”**.

#### 14 · Rationale (state‑of‑the‑art alignment, post‑2015)

* **Metrical mereology** advances (e.g., recent work on quantity‑based parthood and additivity) motivate **PortionOf** with explicit μ and Σ‑laws, preventing the classic “stuff as components” fallacy.
* **Temporal parts & identity through change** (renewed treatments in analytic metaphysics and formal ontology) motivate **PhaseOf** with coverage/non‑overlap and escalation when identity criteria fail.
* **Engineering ontologies (BORO lineage, Core Constructional practice, ISO 15926 family)** keep a strict separation between **functional breakdowns** (our Roles) and **product breakdowns** (our Components), with **stock/consumable** modelling (our Portions) handled by quantities, not by component trees.
* **Knowledge artefact lifecycles** in contemporary MBSE and open‑science workflows use explicit versioning (our PhaseOf) and provenance‑preserving composition (our ConstituentOf).
* The net effect is a **minimal‑sufficient** catalogue: two added sub‑relations close real modelling gaps while preserving **parsimony**, **didactic clarity**, and **Γ‑compatibility** across domains.

### A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment (Contextual Enactment)  \[A]

#### 1 · Intent & Context

In any complex system, from a software project to a biological cell, there is a fundamental distinction between **what something is** (its structure), **what it is supposed to do** (its role and specified capability), and **what it actually does** (its work). Confusing these layers is a primary source of design flaws, budget overruns, and failed projects. Teams argue about a "process" without clarifying if they mean the documented procedure, the team's ability to execute it, or a specific execution that happened last Tuesday.

This pattern provides the canonical alignment for modeling contextual enactment in FPF, serving as the ultimate implementation of the **Strict Distinction Principle (A.7)**. It weaves together several foundational concepts into a single, coherent model of how intention becomes action:
*   **A.2 (Contextual Role Assignment):** Provides the `Holder#Role:Context` structure for assigning roles.
*   **A.4 (Temporal Duality):** Provides the strict separation between `design-time` and `run-time`.
*   **A.12 (External Transformer):** Ensures that all actions are attributed to an external agent.

The intent of this pattern is to establish a normative, unambiguous vocabulary and set of relations for describing the entire evolution of an action, from the specification of a capability to its concrete, resource-consuming execution.

To keep plan–run separation explicit, this pattern references **A.15.2 `U.WorkPlan`** for **schedules/calendars** and **A.15.1 `U.Work`** for **dated execution**. Ambiguous terms like “process / workflow / schedule” are constrained by **L‑PROC / L‑FUNC / L‑SCHED** (E‑cluster): a _workflow_ is a **Method/MethodDescription**, a _schedule_ is a **WorkPlan**, and what _happened_ is **Work**.

**Terminology note (L‑ACT).** The words _action/activity_ are **not normative** in the kernel. When a generic “doing” is needed, we use the didactic term **enactment** (not a type). Normative references must be to **`U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription` / `U.Work` / `U.WorkPlan`**. See lexical rules **L‑PROC / L‑FUNC / L‑SCHED / L‑ACT**

#### 2 · Problem

Without this formal framework, models suffer from a cascade of category errors:

1.  **Role-as-Part:** A Role (e.g., `AuditorRole`) is incorrectly placed inside a structural bill-of-materials (`ComponentOf`), making the system's architecture brittle and nonsensical.
2.  **Specification-as-Execution:** A `MethodDescription` (the "recipe") is treated as evidence that the work was done. This leads to "paper compliance," where a system is considered complete simply because its documentation exists.
3.  **Capability-as-Work:** A team's *ability* to perform a task (`Capability`) is conflated with the *actual performance* of that task (`Work`). This obscures the reality of resource consumption and actual outcomes.
4.  **Work-without-Context:** An instance of work is logged without a clear link back to the role, capability, and specification that governed it, making the work unauditable and its results impossible to reproduce.
5.  **Ambiguous "Process/Activity":** The overloaded term "process" is used indiscriminately to refer to all of the above, creating a fog of miscommunication that paralyzes decision-making. Activity/action terms must be resolved via L‑ACT to Method/MethodDescription (recipe), WorkPlan (schedule), or Work (run).

#### 3 · Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Structure vs. Function** | The need to model the stable, physical structure of a system (`mereology`) vs. the need to model its dynamic, functional behavior (`roles` and `actions`). |
| **Design vs. Run** | The need for a timeless, reusable description of a capability (`design-time`) vs. the need for a specific, dated record of its execution (`run-time`). |
| **Clarity vs. Jargon** | The need for a precise, formal vocabulary to prevent ambiguity vs. the reality that teams use informal, domain-specific jargon like "process" or "workflow." |
| **Accountability vs. Complexity** | The need for a complete, end-to-end audit trail for every action vs. the desire to keep models simple and avoid excessive documentation. |

#### 4 · Solution
The solution is a stratified alignment that cleanly separates the `design-time` and `run-time` for contextual **enactment**. The bridge between these worlds is the **`U.RoleAssignment`**.

#### 4.1 The Core Entities: A Strict Distinction

FPF mandates the use of the following distinct, non-overlapping entities to model action. Using them interchangeably is a conformance violation.

**A) Design-Time Entities (The World of Potential):**

*   **`U.Role`:** A contextual "mask" or "job title" (e.g., `TesterRole`). It specifies a function but is not the function itself.
*  **`U.Method`:** The **abstract way‑of‑doing** inside a context (paradigm‑agnostic; may be imperative, functional, logical, or hybrid).
*  **`U.MethodDescription`:** A **`U.Episteme` describing a `U.Method`** (the SOP/algorithm/proof/recipe on a carrier).
*   **`U.Capability`:** An **attribute** of a `U.System` that represents its **ability** to perform the actions described in a `MethodDescription`. This is the "skill" or "know-how."
* **`U.WorkPlan`:** An **`U.Episteme`** declaring **intended `U.Work` occurrences** (windows, dependencies, intended performers as role kinds, budgets) — see **A.15.2**.
* 
**B) The Bridge Entity:**
*   **`U.RoleAssignment`:** The formal assertion `Holder#Role:Context` that links a specific `U.Holon` to a `U.Role` within a `U.BoundedContext`. This binding is what "activates" the requirements associated with a role.

**C) Run-Time Entity (The World of Actuality):**

*   **`U.Work`:** An **occurrence** or **event**. It is the concrete, dated, resource-consuming **execution of a `U.MethodDescription`** by a `Holder` acting under a `U.RoleAssignment`; capability checks are evaluated at run time against the holder. This is the only entity that has a start and end time and consumes resources.

**Kinds of Work and the primary target**
Every `U.Work` SHALL declare a `primaryTarget: U.Holon` and a `kind`.
Kinds:
* Operational — transforms a `U.System` or its environment.
* Communicative (SpeechAct) — transforms a deontic/organizational frame (e.g., commitments, permissions, approvals).
* Epistemic — transforms a `U.Episteme` (e.g., curating a dataset).
The `primaryTarget` disambiguates enactment: what is being acted upon. Example: an approval is `kind=Communicative`, `primaryTarget = Commitment(change=4711)`. A deployment is `kind=Operational`, `primaryTarget = ServiceInstance(prod-us-eu-1)`.

**Didactic Note for Managers: The "Chef" Analogy**

This model can be easily understood using the analogy of a chef in a restaurant.

*   **`ChefRole`** is the **Role**. It's a job title with certain expectations.
*   A **Cookbook (`U.MethodDescription`)** contains the **recipe** for a Soufflé. It's a piece of knowledge.
*   The chef's **skill** in making soufflés is their **`U.Capability`**. They have this skill even when they are not cooking.
*   The restaurant's rulebook (`U.BoundedContext`) states that anyone in the `ChefRole` *must* have the `Capability` to follow the recipes in the cookbook.
*   The actual act of **making a soufflé** on Tuesday evening—using eggs and butter, taking 25 minutes, and consuming gas—is the **`U.Work`**.

Confusing these is like mistaking the cookbook for the soufflé. FPF's framework simply makes these common-sense distinctions formal and mandatory.

#### 4.2 The Canonical Relations: Connecting the Layers

The entities are connected by a set of precise, normative relations that form an unbreakable causal chain. The following diagram illustrates this flow from the abstract context down to the concrete execution.

    style W fill:#ffe6cc,stroke:#d79b00,stroke-width:2px,font-weight:bold
```

*   **`bindsCapability(Role, Capability)`:** A `U.BoundedContext` asserts that a given `Role` requires a specific `Capability`. This is a `design-time` rule.
*  **`isDescribedBy(Method, MethodDescription)`:** A `Capability` is formally described by one or more `MethodDescription`s. This links the skill to the recipe.
*   **`isExecutionOf(Work, MethodDescription)`:** A specific `U.Work` is a `run-time` instance of a `design-time` `Capability`.
*   **`performedBy(Work, RoleAssigning)`:** A `U.Work` is always performed by a specific `Agent` (a RoleAssignment). This links the action to the actor-in-context.

_At run time, capability thresholds declared by the context/spec are **checked** against the holder; Work outcomes provide **evidence** for capability conformance._

This chain provides complete traceability: a specific instance of `Work` can be traced back through its `Capability` to its `MethodDescription`, and to the `Agent` (`Holder` + `Role` + `Context`) that was authorized and responsible for its execution.

#### 5 · Archetypal Grounding

The Contextual Action Framework is universal. It applies identically to the modeling of physical engineering processes, knowledge work, and socio-technical systems.

| Archetype | **`U.System` Archetype (Manufacturing)** | **`U.Episteme` Archetype (Scientific Peer Review)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`BoundedContext`** | `FactoryFloor:ProductionLine_B` | `Journal:PhysicsLetters_A` |
| **`Role`** | `WeldingRobotRole` | `ReviewerRole` |
| **`Holder`** | `ABB_Robot_Model_IRB_6700` (`U.System`) | `Dr_Alice_Smith` (modeled as a `U.System`) |
| **`U.RoleAssignment`** | `ABB_Robot#WeldingRobotRole:Line_B` | `Dr_Smith#ReviewerRole:PhysicsLetters_A` |
| **`MethodDescription` (`U.Episteme`)**| `Welding_Procedure_WP-28A.pdf` (SOP) | `Peer_Review_Guidelines_v3.docx` |
| **`Capability` (Attribute of Holder)** | `executeWeldingSeam(Type: 3F)` | `evaluateManuscript(Field: QuantumOptics)` |
| **`Work` (`Occurrence`)** | Manufacturing Work: `Weld_Job_#78345` (15:32-15:34 UTC, consumed 1.2 kWh, 5g Argon) — **isExecutionOf** `Welding_Procedure_WP‑28A.pdf` | Peer‑review Work: `Review_of_Manuscript_#PL-2025-018` (Completed 2025-08-15, took 4 hours) — **isExecutionOf** `Peer_Review_Guidelines_v3.docx` |

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
This side-by-side comparison reveals the power of the framework. A seemingly different activity like welding a car chassis and reviewing a scientific paper are shown to have the **exact same underlying causal structure**. Both involve a `Holder` (a system) acting in a `Role` within a `Context`, using a `Capability` described by a `MethodDescription` to produce a specific, auditable instance of `Work`. This universality is what allows FPF to bridge disparate domains.

#### 6 · Conformance Checklist

To ensure the integrity of action modeling, all FPF-compliant models must adhere to the following normative checks.

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A15-1 (Entity Distinction)** | The entities `U.Role`, **`U.Method`**, **`U.MethodDescription`**, `U.Capability`, **`U.WorkPlan`**, and `U.Work` **MUST** be modeled as distinct, non‑overlapping types. | This is the core enforcement of **Strict Distinction (A.7)**. It prevents the category errors outlined in the "Problem" section. |
| **CC-A15-2 (Temporal Scope)** | `U.Method`/`U.MethodDescription`/`U.WorkPlan` exist in **design‑time**; `U.Work` exists in **run‑time**. Design artifacts are not mutated by operational events. | Enforces **Temporal Duality (A.4)**. Blueprints cannot be mutated by operational events. |
| **CC-A15-3 (RoleAssignment Mandate)**| Every `U.Work` **MUST** be linked via `performedBy` to a valid `U.RoleAssignment`. | Guarantees that every action has a clearly identified, context-bound actor, ensuring accountability. |
| **CC-A15-4 (Traceability Chain)**| For every `U.Work`, an unbroken chain **MUST** exist: `Work —performedBy→ RoleAssigning` and `Work —isExecutionOf→ MethodDescription —describes→ Method`. Capability checks are evaluated against the holder at run time. | Ensures end-to-end auditability from a specific action back to the "recipe" that governed it. |
| **CC-A15-5 (No Roles in Mereology)** | A `U.Role` or `U.Capability` **SHALL NOT** be part of a mereological (`partOf`) hierarchy. | The "Role-as-Part" anti-pattern is a violation. Roles and capabilities are functional, not structural. Enforces **A.14**. |
| **CC-A15-6 (Resource Honesty)** | Resource consumption (`U.Resource`) **MUST** only be associated with `U.Work`, never with `U.MethodDescription` or `U.Capability`. | Enforces that costs are tied to actual events, not to plans or potential. Aligns with **Resrc-CAL (C.5)**. |
| **CC‑A15‑7 (Plan/Run Split)** | Schedules/calendars **MUST** be represented as `U.WorkPlan` (A.15.2). A WorkPlan SHALL NOT be used as evidence of execution; only `U.Work` carries actuals. | |
| **CC‑A15‑8 (Lexical Sanity)** | Unqualified “process/workflow/schedule” **MUST** be interpreted per **L‑PROC/L‑FUNC/L‑SCHED**: workflow ⇒ `Method/MethodDescription`; schedule ⇒ `WorkPlan`; what happened ⇒ `Work`. | |
| **CC-A15-9 (Realisation)** | A valid `U.Work` realises a `U.MethodDescription` under a `U.RoleAssignment`. Spontaneous physical evolution without a MethodDescription is modeled as `U.Dynamics`, not as `U.Work`. | |
| **CC-A15-10 (GateSplit)** | A SpeechAct that changes a Role’s state (e.g., “Approve”, “Authorize”) MUST be modeled as a distinct `U.Work` step (kind=Communicative). It may open the Green‑Gate for a subsequent operational step, but it SHALL NOT be conflated with that step. | |
| **CC-A15-11 (KindFit)** The `U.Role` named in the `performedBy` assignment SHALL be appropriate for the Work kind (e.g., ApproverRole for Communicative approvals; DeployerRole for Operational deployments). | |

#### 7 · Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unambiguous Communication:** Provides a shared, precise vocabulary for teams to discuss roles, processes, and results, eliminating the ambiguity of terms like "process." | **Initial Learning Curve:** Requires teams to learn and internalize the distinctions between the core entities. *Mitigation:* The "Chef" analogy and clear archetypes serve as powerful didactic tools. FPF tooling should guide users with templates. |
| **End-to-End Auditability:** The framework creates a "digital thread" that links every operational event (`Work`) back to its authorizing role, context, and specification. This is critical for regulated industries and for root cause analysis. | **Increased Formality:** Requires more explicit modeling than informal approaches. *Mitigation:* This is a strategic investment. The upfront cost of formal modeling is offset by massive savings in debugging, re-work, and compliance efforts later. |
| **Enables True Modularity:** By separating capability from execution, the framework allows for easier substitution. A `MethodDescription` can be updated without invalidating past `Work` records. A `Holder` can be replaced with another, as long as it possesses the same `Capability`. | - |
| **Foundation for Governance:** The model makes it possible to build powerful governance rules. For example: "Only an `Agent` with `AuditorRole` can execute `Work` that instantiates the `ApproveRelease` capability." | - |

#### 8 · Rationale

This pattern solves a problem that has plagued systems modeling for decades: the conflation of what a system *is* with what it *does*. Its rigor is not arbitrary but is grounded in several key intellectual traditions.

*   **Ontology Engineering:** The pattern is a direct application of best practices from foundational ontologies (like UFO), which have long insisted on the distinction between *endurants* (objects like a `U.System`) and *perdurants* (events/processes like `U.Work`), and between intrinsic properties and relational roles. FPF makes these powerful distinctions accessible to practicing engineers.
*   **Process Theory:** Formalisms like the Pi-calculus or Petri Nets model processes as dynamic interactions. The FPF Contextual Action Framework provides a higher-level, more semantically rich layer on top of such formalisms. The `U.Work` entity can be seen as an instance of a process, but FPF adds the crucial context of the `Role`, `Capability`, and `MethodDescription` that govern it.
*   **Pragmatism and Practice:** The framework is deeply pragmatic. The distinctions it makes (e.g., between a `MethodDescription` and `Work`) are precisely the ones that matter in the real world of project management, compliance, and debugging. When a failure occurs, a manager needs to know: was the recipe wrong (`MethodDescription`), did the chef lack the skill (`Capability`), or did they just make a mistake this one time (`Work`)? This framework provides the vocabulary to ask and answer that question precisely.

By creating this clean, stratified alignment for enactment, FPF provides a stable and scalable foundation for all of its more advanced architheories, from resource management (`Resrc-CAL`) and decision theory (`Decsn-CAL`) to ethics (`Norm-CAL`).

#### 9 · Relations
