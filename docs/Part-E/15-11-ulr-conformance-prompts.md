## 11 · ULR conformance prompts *(normative, concept‑only questions)*

> Use these **prompts** during review. They reference § 7 (MG·DA) and § 8 (LEX.Morph) instead of repeating them.

1. **Context prompt.** Does each potentially polysemous noun live inside a **named `U.BoundedContext`**?
2. **Layer prompt.** Is each sentence in the correct **I/D/S layer** (I: type/role; D: description/spec; run: actuals)?
3. **Token prompt.** For new/renamed tokens, is **`LEX.TokenClass`** declared and consistent with where the token appears?
4. **Object‑of‑talk prompt.** Does the **head noun** name the object being classified (Role/Method/Service/Work/Context/Characteristic)?
5. **Morphology prompt.** Do suffix/prefix/casing pass **LEX.Morph** gates (e.g., `…Role`, `MethodDescription`, `Work`)?
6. **Promise vs ability vs performance.** Are **Service** (promise), **Capability** (ability), and **Work** (performance) distinct?
7. **Plan vs execution.** Are **WorkPlan** windows separated from **Work** actuals?
8. **Evidence prompt.** Do documents **hold roles** and **justify**, while **systems act**?
9. **Bridge prompt.** If sameness spans Contexts, is there an explicit **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes?
10. **Collision prompt.** Did we run full‑text + Reserved‑Names checks (no other meaning of this token anywhere in FPF)?
