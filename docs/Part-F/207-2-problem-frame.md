## 2 · Problem frame

Left unchecked, Role/Status vocabularies tend to **diverge**:

1. **Synonym stacks.** *Reviewer*, *Approver*, *Validator*, *Verifier* minted separately despite overlapping responsibilities.
2. **Modifier creep.** *Night‑Operator*, *Shift‑Operator*, *Remote‑Operator* proliferate where one Role plus a window would suffice.
3. **SoD leakage.** New names invented to **evade** an intended separation (*Requestor‑Approver* as one Role).
4. **Status paintjobs.** *Compliant*, *At‑Risk*, *Grace*, *Waived*, *Temporarily‑Breached*—labels multiply where a **single Status × window** model would be clearer.
5. **Context blending.** A control‑Context *Actuator* gets treated as an Enactment *Execution* Role; a deontic *Duty* becomes a runtime *Status*.

Explosion harms didactics and increases alignment cost (F.9).
