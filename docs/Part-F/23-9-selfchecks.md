## 9 · Self‑checks (mental, not procedural)

* **The mirror test.** Can you explain *why each Context is inside* your cut **in one breath**? If not, you are surveying for comfort, not for meaning.
* **The homonym ping.** For each frequent word (*process*, *role*, *service*, *model*, *execution*), can you immediately list **the Contexts where it differs**? If not, add the missing Context.
* **The bridge itch.** Feel a strong urge to say “these are the same”? Good. **Write the itch down** and refuse to scratch it here. That’s F.9’s job.
* **The memory rule.** If your entire survey cannot be recalled **without opening a document**, it is too large.
