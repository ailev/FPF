> “A **Concept-Set row** shows **one idea across Contexts**—but only where explicit **Bridges** license it. Columns are Contexts; cells are **their own labels**. The row prints a **scope** (‘Naming-only’, ‘assignment/enactment-eligibility’, ‘Type-structure’, ‘KD-metric’) and the **weakest CL** that justifies reading across. A **one‑line rationale** says why sameness is safe **here**; a **counter‑example** warns where it breaks. Keep rows small (2–4 Contexts), typed (don’t mix senseFamilies), and temporally honest (design vs run stance). If Bridges don’t suffice, publish a **contrast row** instead. The table doesn’t invent meaning; it **summarises licensed sameness** so readers can cross disciplines without smuggling assumptions.”
