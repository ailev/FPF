## 15 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Usage clarifies → merge.** If two Local‑Senses never lead to different conclusions in the Context’s canon, **merge** and keep the narrower sense line.
2. **Usage diverges → split.** If new reading reveals incompatible roles/entailments, **split** and attach a counter‑example to each side.
3. **Edition change → new Context.** When a new edition **reframes** usage, treat it as a **separate Context** (F.1) and re‑cluster there.
4. **Label upkeep.** If the Plain label tempts broadening, tighten it; if the Tech label drifts from idiom, restore the canon term.
5. **Dormant sense.** If a Local‑Sense ceases to matter for any active line, leave it listed but mark it **low‑use** in your own notes; do not fold it into another unless rule 1 holds.
6. **Bridge temptation.** Record tensions to bridge **elsewhere**; F.3 never resolves Cross‑context relations.
