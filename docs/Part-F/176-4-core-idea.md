## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Bind promises to runs with measurements in time.**
Acceptance is a **quadruple of anchors** (all context‑local):

1. **ClauseCell** — a deontic/Standardual **SenseCell** stating the promise (*availability ≥ 99.9%*, *MTTR ≤ 60 min*, *temperature within band*).
2. **WorkCell** — a **SenseCell** for the **Work** that enacted the service in the relevant situation.
3. **MeasureCell** — a **SenseCell** for the **Observation/Characteristic** used as evidence (KD‑CAL).
4. **Window** — the explicit period in which the judgement is made (F.10).

A **Predicate** compares the **Measure** against the **Clause** within the **Window**.
The **Status** (Satisfied/Violated/Inconclusive) attaches to **ClauseCell\@Window about WorkCell**, never to a plan.
