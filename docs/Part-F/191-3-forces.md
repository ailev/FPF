## 3 · Forces

| Force                          | Tension to resolve                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continuity vs truthfulness** | Preserve readers’ continuity yet surface real sense changes (no paint‑over).                 |
| **Locality vs convenience**    | Keep aliases **inside Contexts** even when a catchy global name tempts reuse.                   |
| **Simplicity vs coverage**     | Avoid giant synonym lists while still catching the one or two legacy names people will meet. |
| **Didactics vs formality**     | Make the mapping teachable without inventing new low‑level artefacts or processes.           |
