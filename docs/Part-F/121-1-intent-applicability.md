## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual discipline** for relating **SenseCells** from **different Contexts (U.BoundedContext)**. A **Bridge** states *what kind* of relationship holds, *how far* it holds (via **CL: Congruence Level**), and *what is lost* during the translation. Bridges **permit carefully scoped reuse** (e.g., a Concept‑Set row) while **forbidding silent equivalence**.

**Applicability.** Use **whenever** an author needs to **read across Contexts**—to reuse a familiar label, to connect design‑time and run‑time notions, to compare two standards’ terms, or to justify a row in the Concept‑Set table. This pattern is **not** storage, workflow, or governance; it codifies **thinking moves**.

**Non‑goals.** No global meaning; no tool/API; no editor roles. Bridges are **semantic relations between local senses**, not pipelines, not processes.
