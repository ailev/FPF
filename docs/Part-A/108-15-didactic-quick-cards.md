* **Method / MethodDescription / Work** = *how in principle* / *how it is written* / *how it went this time*.
* **Four‑slot grammar:** Who? → **RoleAssigning**. Can? → **Capability**. How? → **Method** (via **MethodDescription**). Did? → **Work**.
* **Design‑time vs run‑time:** Composition of Methods ≠ composition of Work.

* **Keep time and people out:** Schedules → **WorkPlan**; assignees → **RoleAssigning**.
