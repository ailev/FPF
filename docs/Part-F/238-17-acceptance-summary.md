## 17 · Acceptance summary (“Harness green”)

A unification slice is **publish‑ready** when:

1. **All SCR (S‑Local & S‑Cross) hold** for the current snapshot (Contexts, Local‑Senses, SenseCells, rows, Role Descriptions, Bridges, windows).
2. **All RSCR (R‑Evo) hold** against the previous snapshot: no silent replacements; rows either unchanged or retired+reborn; Bridges re‑validated with CL non‑inflated without witnesses; windows adjusted only for real variance; SoD intact.
3. **One micro‑witness per moving part** exists in the text (tiny example showing the check in action).
4. **Memory rule still holds**: the active Context set for the line fits in a careful mind without external aids (F.1).
