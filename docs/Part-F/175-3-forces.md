| Force                                | Tension to resolve                                                                                        |

| **Promise vs. occurrence**           | Service is defined as an external **promise** (A.2.3), yet acceptance must reference **Work** (run‑time). |
| **Locality vs. integration**         | Meanings are **context‑local**; still we must compare across services, plants, and monitors.                 |
| **Parsimony vs. realism**            | We want a small binding scheme, yet domains differ (percentiles, downtime minutes, control margins).      |
| **Evidence vs. privacy/feasibility** | Observations prove outcomes; sometimes only proxies exist.                                                |
