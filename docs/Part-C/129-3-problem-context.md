## 3 · Problem & Context (Informative)

### 3.1 The problem C.16 solves

Across architheories, people say “score”, “metric”, “rating”, “property”. Without a shared substrate, numbers drift: *42 of what? on which scale? comparable to whom?* C.16 eliminates drift by requiring every metric notion to **bind** to **one** Characteristic and **one** Scale, and by **separating** intensional anchors from descriptions and gauges. The result is **portable meaning**: a measure is always readable as a **Coordinate on a declared Scale of a named Characteristic**, with a principled path to evidence. 

### 3.2 Context and prior art

* **Kernel canon.** A.17 makes **Characteristic** the sole canonical anchor for measurability; A.18 fixes **CSLC** as the minimal sufficiency for interpretability. C.16 relies on both.
* **Cross‑domain alignment.** The MM‑CHR family already maps FPF U.Types to **ISO 80000‑1 (Quantity)**, **ISO/IEC 25024 (Data‑quality Characteristic)**, **QUDT (QuantityKind/QuantityValue)**, **W3C SOSA/SSN (Observable/Observed/Result)**, and domain “feature/metric” usage (Verspoor, TF Metrics). C.16 uses these rows **as Bridges** (Part F), preserving local senses and documenting losses.  
* **Open‑ended evolution.** FPF replaces “lifecycle” with **Reachable‑States Graph (RSG)**: movement is along **certified states** with checklists; measurement work adopts the same open‑endedness (re‑entry allowed when distinctions change). C.16 uses RSG to frame **readiness** and **revision** of metric notions conceptually (no processes implied).
