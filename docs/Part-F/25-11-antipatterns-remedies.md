| #       | Anti‑pattern               | Symptom in practice                                                                  | Why it harms thinking                                          | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **“One‑Book Domain”**      | Everything is justified from a single canon (“X is the domain”).                     | Projectionism; blinds heterogeneity; brittle to new editions.  | Enforce **heterogeneity**: pick **≥ 3 distinct domain families** per unification line (§6 Step 2, §8‑3).                |
| **A2**  | **Context‑less talking**   | Words like *process*, *role*, *service* used without naming a Context.                  | Global words drift; later steps must guess meaning.            | Always **prefix with the Context** in thought and prose: *process (BPMN)*, *activity (PROV)*, *service (ITIL)* (§4, §7.2). |
| **A3**  | **Edition blur**           | “BPMN” or “ITIL” cited with no year or profile.                                      | Inadvertent sense shifts; debates about “what the book says.”  | Cards keep **name + edition** on the first line; think with the exact edition (§7.2).                                   |
| **A4**  | **Phonebook survey**       | Dozens of Contexts; no one can recall the cut.                                          | Violates didactic primacy; people default to global talk.      | **Parsimony rule**: 1–3 Contexts per family, just enough to reveal key sense‑splits (§6 Step 5, §8‑4, §9 “memory rule”).   |
| **A5**  | **Bridge‑by‑stealth**      | Phrases like “these are basically the same” inside the survey.                       | Hides losses; imports meaning across Contexts without scrutiny.   | **No bridging here**; write the *itch to bridge* down and defer to **F.9** (§6 Step 6, §8‑5).                           |
| **A6**  | **Role/status conflation** | *Role (RBAC)* treated as behavioural mask; *duty (ODRL)* treated as service runtime. | Category bleed across families.                                | Cards carry **lexical trip‑wires** (“RBAC role ≠ behavioural role”; “duty ≠ runtime guarantee”) (§7.2).                 |
| **A7**  | **Temporal fudge**         | *Activity* or *execution* discussed without run/design stance.                       | Misplaced assertions; design artefacts treated as occurrences. | Cards note **time stance** when inherent (design vs run) (§7.2, §8‑6).                                                  |
| **A8**  | **Domain = Context**       | A “domain” label used as if it were a Context (e.g., “control” == one context).         | Shelf label mistaken for a canon; sense becomes fuzzy.         | **Domain family is informative only**; Contexts are **U.BoundedContext** tied to specific canons (§5, §7.2).               |
| **A9**  | **Context inheritance**    | Arranging Contexts in is‑a hierarchies (“PROV is‑a BPMN”).                              | Suggests meaning flows by inheritance; erases locality.        | **No is‑a among Contexts**; relations between Contexts live in **F.9 bridges** (§8‑5).                                        |
| **A10** | **Didactic bloat**         | Context Card spills into pages of notes.                                             | Teaching burden overwhelms the core idea.                      | **One‑screen Card**; everything else belongs to later patterns (§7.1–§7.2).                                             |
| **A11** | **Family‑based inference** | Treating Domain‑family membership as implying similarity/equivalence. | Smuggles semantics via shelf labels; breaks locality. | **Domain family is informative only**; locality and any Cross‑context relation must be explicit (F.9). |
