## 1 · Purpose & Audience

This pattern gives **engineering managers and assurance architects** one vocabulary, one model, and one set of operations to talk about **where** a claim holds and **under which conditions** a system can deliver a piece of **Work**. It removes the need to remember whether a document said “applicability,” a model said “envelope,” or a safety plan said “capability envelope.” **Scope is scope.** The only distinction that matters is **what carries it**:

* **Knowledge/episteme** → **Claim scope** (G).
* **System/capability** → **Work scope** (conditions under which Work at the promised measures is deliverable).

With USM, teams can:

* specify, compare, and compose scope **without translation games**;
* gate ESG and Method–Work steps with **observable, context‑local scope checks**;
* cross Contexts safely using Bridges and **explicit CL penalties** applied to **R**.

This pattern **defines** the **scope mechanism** (Context slices, set‑valued scopes, algebra, and guard usage) and the canonical **lexicon** (Claim scope (G), Work scope). It does **not** prescribe which Contexts must widen/narrow scope, nor which assurance levels are required; those are set by context‑local ESG and Method–Work policies, which SHALL reference the mechanisms defined here.
