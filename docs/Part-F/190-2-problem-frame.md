## 2 · Problem frame

Unification efforts rot when names drift faster than senses or, worse, when senses change under a constant name.

* **Silent relabeling.** A new label is introduced as if nothing changed; readers cannot connect past to present.
* **Alias bloat.** Synonyms accumulate without discipline; reading becomes guesswork.
* **Cross‑context aliasing.** A single alias is made to stand for different Contexts (“global slang”), defeating locality.
* **Retroactive edits.** Old texts are silently rewritten to today’s names, corrupting provenance.
