| Force                       | Tension to resolve                                                                            |

| **Parsimony vs coverage**   | Avoid new names unless necessary, yet cover recurring Cross‑context readings.                    |
| **Locality vs unification** | Keep senses **in‑Context**; when reading across, do it **explicitly** and only as far as needed. |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**   | Give readers one label to hold, but never over‑state sameness (respect CL and scope).         |
