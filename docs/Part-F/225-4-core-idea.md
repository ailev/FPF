## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

The harness is a **two‑tier net of assertions**:

* **SCR — Static Conformance Rules.** context‑local and cross‑artefact checks that must hold **now**.
* **RSCR — Regression & Stability Rules.** Checks that must hold **across changes** (editions, rows, names).

All checks are expressed as **judgement schemas** (premises ⊢ conclusion). They **never** prescribe artefact formats, roles, or workflows.
