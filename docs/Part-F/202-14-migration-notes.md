## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual playbook)

1. **Ask the same‑sense question first.** If the underlying **SenseCell/row** is unchanged, prefer `renames`; else reach for `splits/merges`.
2. **Keep it inside the Context.** If your explanation crosses Contexts, stop—this is **Bridge** territory (F.9), not a rename.
3. **Prefer clarity over fashion.** Rename only when the new label **removes a real ambiguity** (F.5 criteria), not to chase style.
4. **Limit nostalgia.** Admit **one** legacy alias in each register that readers will most likely meet; leave the rest to footnotes in examples.
5. **Deprecate with kindness.** When retiring a label, add a one‑line **pointer note** (e.g., “see `timer event` in BPMN; ‘heartbeat’ in KD‑CAL means sensor liveness”).
6. **Rows before names.** If a rename request coincides with a shift in what the row covers, **refactor rows** (F.7) first, then choose labels.
7. **Edition bumps.** When a canon updates, check labels used in that Context: if definitions shift, it’s a **split/merge**; if not, you may `renames` for style/uniformity.
8. **Teach the delta.** In primers, show a **mini table** with legacy → preferred pairs only where readers will encounter both.
