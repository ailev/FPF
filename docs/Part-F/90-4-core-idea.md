## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

A **Concept‑Set** is a **finite set of addresses**

$$
\text{CS}=\{\langle \text{Context}_i,\ \text{SenseCell}_i\rangle\}_{i=1..n}
$$

that FPF **treats as one** *for a declared scope* because there exist **F.9 Bridges** connecting these SenseCells pairwise (directly or via a short chain) with **congruence level** $\text{CL}$ above a **threshold** suitable for that scope. The **table row** shows:

* **FPF Label** *(Tech/Plain)* — the *didactic, FPF‑level* name chosen per F.5.
* **Row Scope** — where “being one” is safe (e.g., *Naming-only*, *assignment/enactment-eligibility*, *KD-CAL metric*, *Type‑structure*).
* **Row CL(min)** — the **minimum CL** of the Bridges that justify the row.
* **Context columns** — each cell: the **local label** + (optional) short cue.
* **Rationale (one line)** — why sameness is warranted *for this scope*.
* **Counter‑examples (one line)** — where/why sameness **breaks**.

> **Memory hook.** *A Concept‑Set row is a promise:* “You may **read across** these Contexts **this far—and no farther**.”
