## 5 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑B.5.2.1‑1 (CHR discipline).** If a Context uses this plug‑in, it **SHALL** declare the Creativity‑CHR **Characteristics** with **A.18**‑style templates (type, unit/range, polarity). No new kernel terms are introduced.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑2 (Instrumented generation).** Step 2 of **B.5.2** **SHALL** either (a) invoke *NQD‑Generate* or (b) justify a Context‑specific generator of equivalent effect (diversity + quality + novelty with measurable **Characteristics**).
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑3 (Diversity coupling).** When this plug‑in is used, **D MUST be ΔDiversity_P** computed against the current candidate Pool using the **C.17** definition of **Diversity_P** under the same Context, CharacteristicSpace, kernel, and TimeWindow.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑Eligibility**: Eligibility requires **(i)** `ConstraintFit = pass` for the candidate (Norm‑CAL must‑set), **then (ii)** **USM** coverage for the TargetSlice and **(iii)** an enactable **RSG** state for the performer; only then may calls to `Γ_nqd.*` occur.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑4 (Non‑dominated shortlist).** The *CandidateSet* **MUST** include the **Pareto front** over `{Q₁…Q_k, N, D}`; any pruned candidate **MUST** carry a DRR note (“dominated by … on {Characteristics}”).
**CC‑B5.2.1‑5 (Abductive primacy preserved).** The plug‑in **MUST NOT** bypass the ADI ordering mandated by **B.5**: induction may not start before deduction; abductive L0 creation remains the start.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑6 (Normalization for Pareto).** When **Q** has multiple components with different units/scales, Contexts **SHALL** normalize or use declared utility‑free monotone transforms before dominance tests.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑7 (Use‑Value separation). ** If Use‑Value (C.17 §5.2) is recorded, it SHALL remain outside Assurance scores; it MAY inform decision lenses (Decsn‑CAL). Do not alter **R/G** semantics based on Use‑Value. (see **C.17 §5.2** for `Use-Value / ValueGain` definition)
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑8 (Provenance).** Each `h_i` in the *CandidateSet* **MUST** reference its `provenance_i` sufficient to reproduce scores given the same `Policy(TimeWindow)`, score/metric versions, and `DeterminismSeed?`.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑9 (Secondary metrics).** **I (illumination)** and **S (surprise)** SHALL be used only for tie‑breaking/reporting unless explicitly promoted by policy; the **primary dominance test is over {Q components}** by default.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑10 (Cell capacity & ε).** If `K>1` or `ε>0` are used, the values MUST be declared and recorded in provenance; any thinning AFTER recording the front SHALL be documented in the DRR.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑11 (Dominance set).** By default the dominance set **SHALL be {Q components}**; **N (Novelty@context)** and **ΔDiversity_P** act as **tie‑breakers** unless explicitly promoted by **policy** (record the policy‑id in provenance).
