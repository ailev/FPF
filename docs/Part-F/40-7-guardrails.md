## 7 · Guard‑rails (normative, lightweight)

1. **context‑locality.** Every local lexical unit **MUST** cite a Context (U.BoundedContext from F.1).
2. **Context‑idiom normalisation.** LNF **MUST** respect the Context’s idiom (spelling/hyphenation/casing) and use **minimal edits**.
3. **Two registers.** Each unit **SHOULD** carry both **Tech** and **Plain** labels for didactics; if one is missing, justify.
4. **Minimal generality (G‑1).** The gloss **MUST** be as specific as the Context’s canon requires—no broader.
5. **I/D/S layer hygiene (A.7).** **MUST NOT** include behaviour equations, deontic rules, measurement math, or type axioms; those belong to architheories.
6. **No Cross‑context claims.** **MUST NOT** assert equivalence, subsumption, or similarity with terms in other Contexts (F.9 only).
7. **Edition honesty.** If the Context’s canon has multiple editions with shifting usage, treat them as distinct Contexts in F.1 before harvesting.
8. **Parsimony.** Prefer **few, telling** lexical units over long tails; keep head terms that will power F.3/F.4/F.9.
