## 6) Consequences

**Benefits.**
*Evolutive quality*: patterns improve through **search + selection**, not edits by fiat. *Auditability*: a re‑runnable **LAT** shows *why* the chosen variant won. *Safety*: cross‑context reuse is explicit and penalized appropriately. *Comparability*: Δ‑classes & SemVer let downstream readers predict blast‑radius.

**Trade‑offs.**
Some ceremony (LAT/DRR, NQD lenses) and maintenance (evidence refresh, bridge upkeep). These costs buy reproducibility and SoTA tracking.
