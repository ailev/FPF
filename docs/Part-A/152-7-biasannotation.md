* **Lenses tested:** `Prag`, `Arch`, `Did`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; temporal semantics and episode policy are **context‑local** via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Gives FPF a clean, actionable notion of **occurrence** compatible with `U.RoleAssignment` / **Role Enactment** (A.2.1; A.15) and with 4D extensional thinking, so that costing, quality, and audit rest on **runs**, not on plans or recipes.
