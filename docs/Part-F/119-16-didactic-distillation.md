> “When you feel like coining a new name, pause. **Which senseFamily** are you in—Role, Status, Measurement, Type‑structure, Method, or Execution? If a **single Context’s SenseCell** already says it, **reuse** that label. If you need an assignable Standard, **mint a Role Description** anchored to that SenseCell. If you must read **across Contexts**, reuse a **Concept‑Set row**—but only **at a stated scope** and only if its **CL meets the threshold** (τ). If it’s just a nicer wording, add an **Alias** (style only). Only in the rare case of a cross‑family, **irreducible** notion do you **mint a new U.Type**. Never let Naming‑only rows justify  **Assignment-eligibility** or structural inference, and never let identical strings force equivalence. This is not process—it’s **discipline of thought**: reuse what exists, declare scope when you bridge, and mint new primitives only when the kernel truly needs them.”
