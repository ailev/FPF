| Force                       | Tension                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity vs behaviour**   | Keep holon identity stable while roles/behaviours change.                                   |
| **Simplicity vs precision** | Managers want one “process” box; kernel must keep **MethodDescription / Method / Work** distinct.  |
| **Universality vs idioms**  | Pumps, proofs, and data‑pipelines must read the same, yet allow domain names.               |
| **Design vs run**           | No overlap of **Tᴰ** and **Tᴿ**; bridges explicit and causal.                               |
| **Evidence vs mereology**   | Provenance edges (EPV‑DAG) must never turn into part‑whole edges.                           |
