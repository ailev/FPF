Absent a unified **F**:

1. **Rigor whiplash.** Either everything is forced into premature formalism (blocking exploration), or informal artifacts drift into high‑assurance use (creating silent risks).
2. **Incomparability.** Each Context’s labels mean different things. Reviewers, integrators, and auditors cannot align expectations or compute trustworthy composites.
3. **Lost continuity.** Moving from sketch to proof often becomes a **rewrite**, severing provenance; the same idea looks like different artifacts at each “mode,” inviting translation errors.
4. **Confused roles.** Status (e.g., “accepted here”) gets conflated with rigor (“precise enough”), undermining governance and the KD‑CAL trust math.
