## 6 · Normative rules — U.Types (Cross‑context labels)

Let **U** be a U.Type minted from a **Concept‑Set row** (F.7) satisfying A.8 (≥3 domain families) AND MinInterFamilyDistance ≥ δ_family (from F1‑Card).

+**R‑UT‑1 (Witnessed neutrality).** The Tech label **must not** be a term owned by one context when alternatives exist. Prefer **discipline‑neutral head nouns** (*Result, Reading, Execution, Evidence, Requirement, State, Type Node*). **Use** *Characteristic/Scale/Value/Level/Coordinate/Score/Gauge* **only** when the U.Type denotes a **measurement‑sense** kind anchored in a declared **CharacteristicSpace**; otherwise avoid these measurement‑canon terms to prevent semantics bleed.

**R‑UT‑2 (Minimal generality).** Name the **least upper sense** that all row witnesses share. If *Observation* and *Measurement* disagree, perhaps the U.Type is **Result** or **Reading**, not **Observation**.

**R‑UT‑3 (No senseFamily mixing in names).** Do **not** name a U.Type with deontic or behavioural language (*“PermittedService”*, *“ResponsibleAgent”*). **Role/Status/Method/Execution** belong to **Role Descriptions (F.4)** or local senses; U.Types are *what‑it‑is* kinds, not *what‑it‑does* or *what‑is‑allowed*.

**R‑UT‑4 (Head–modifier discipline).** Prefer **head nouns** with **light modifiers** over stacked compounds.
Good: *Evidence Status*, *Requirement Status*, *Type Node*.
Risky: *Multi‑stage‑workflow‑execution‑record* (compresses a scenario into a name).

**R‑UT‑5 (No Context tags in names).** U.Types are **Context‑agnostic**; never append “(BPMN)”/“(PROV)”. Provenance for the row lives in F.7, not in the name.

**R‑UT‑6 (Alias only for pedagogy).** Allow **Plain aliases** for teaching; **Tech label** is unique and stable. Synonym management belongs to **F.13**; do not invent alternates ad hoc.

**R‑UT‑7 (Family coherence).** When minting a **family**, use **parallel shapes** (*… Status*, *… Level*, *… Characteristic* **only for measurement families with a declared CharacteristicSpace**) so related U.Types signal relation by form.

**R‑UT‑8 (Symbolic names sparingly).** Symbols may be listed as *aliases* for readers of formal sections; they are **never** the U.Type’s Tech label.

**R‑UT‑9 (No edition/version in name).** Versions live in the Concept‑Set evidence; the name denotes a **time‑robust kind**.
