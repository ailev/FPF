# C.3.A · **Typed Guard Macros for Kinds + USM (Annex)**  \[A/I]

> **One‑line summary.** Provides **normative guard macros** that combine **USM Scope** (A.2.6) with **Kind‑CAL** (C.3.x) so authors can gate state changes and compositions that **quantify over kinds** without conflating **describedEntity** (Kinds) with **applicability** (Scope **G**) or **assurance** (**R**). Includes **decision trees, anti‑patterns, and examples** (informative). **AT (KindAT)** is **never** used in guards.
