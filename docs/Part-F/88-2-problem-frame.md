## 2 · Problem frame

Without a disciplined Cross‑context view:

1. **Silent equivalence.** Readers assume sameness by name alone (e.g., *process*).
2. **Loss denial.** Mappings hide what is dropped (DesignRunTag, units, agency).
3. **Name inflation.** New U.Types are coined to avoid facing heterogeneity.
4. **Cognitive scatter.** Concepts drift across documents without one compact, teachable “where‑what‑how‑same” view.
