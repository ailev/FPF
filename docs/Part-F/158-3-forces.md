| Force                        | Tension to resolve                                                                                             |

| **Fidelity vs didactics**    | We must honour domain nuance yet teach a split that fits in working memory.                                    |
| **Universality vs locality** | Quartet must be reusable across architheories, while meanings stay **context‑local**.                             |
| **Evidence vs approval**     | Evidence (run‑time) should support decisions, but must **not** be mistaken for deontic approval (design‑time). |
| **Action vs signal**         | Executing a method is not the same as emitting a control signal; both can co‑occur in one scenario.            |
