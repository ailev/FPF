## 2 · Problem Frame

Even with Contexts fixed (F.1), three mistakes recur:

1. **Word‑centrism.** Treating a string as if it carried its meaning across Contexts (*process*, *role*, *service*).
2. **Over‑normalisation.** Forcing one spelling/morphology across different canons, erasing Context‑specific cues.
3. **Premature structure.** Smuggling behaviour, deontics, or type structures into what should remain **lexical**.

F.2 prevents these by **localising** meaning and **naming** strictly **inside** each Context.
