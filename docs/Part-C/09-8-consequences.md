## 8 · Consequences

**Benefits.** A single, compact **map** for all knowledge artefacts; fast detection of weakest‑link **R** in aggregates; disciplined reuse across domains with explicit **CL**; consistent separation of **meaning** from **material carriers**.
**Trade‑offs.** Authors must learn to declare Γ‑mode and CL explicitly; multi‑notation work requires bridge bookkeeping; *mitigation:* the triangle and ladder keep the discipline brief and repeatable.
