## 6 · The binding, as five mental rules (notation‑free)

**R1 — Locus rule.**
A service verdict **attaches to the Clause**, scoped by a **Window**, **about a specific Work**:
`status(ClauseCell, WorkCell, Window) ∈ {Satisfied, Violated, Inconclusive}`.
*Reading:* We do not place “Satisfied” on the plan or on the whole service concept.

**R2 — Evidence rule.**
Only **Observations** (MeasureCell) that **refer to the outcome of the same Work** and **lie within the Window** may support the verdict.
*Reading:* Control commands and approvals are not evidence of outcome.

**R3 — Predicate rule.**
Every ClauseCell is read with a **Predicate** schema that defines how Measures decide:

* **Threshold:** `value ≥/≤ target`.
* **Percentile:** `Pₚ(value) ≤ target`.
* **Ratio/Share:** `good_time / total_time ≥ target`.
* **Count‑within‑limit:** `count(events of type E) ≤ target`.
* **Band:** `min(value) ≥ L ∧ max(value) ≤ U`.

**R4 — Bridge rule.**
If Clause, Work, and Measure live in **different Contexts**, apply declared **Bridges** with **kind**, **CL**, and **Loss** notes.
*Reading:* Without a Bridge, do not presume transferability of meanings.

**R5 — Window rule.**
Every verdict is **time‑bounded**. Changing the Window can change the result; **no retroactivity** from new clauses or specs (cf. F.10).
