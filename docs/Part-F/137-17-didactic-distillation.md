> “A **Bridge** translates between **local senses** from different **Contexts**. It always declares **what relation** (≈, ⊑, ⋂, ⊥, or an **interpretation** like design↔run), **how strong** (CL 0–3), **which way** (for ⊑/⊒), and **what is lost**. **Substitution** is allowed only on the **same senseFamily** and only with **CL≥2**; **Type‑structure** needs **CL=3**. **Interpretation Bridges** explain, never substitute. Rows in the Concept‑Set table obey the **weakest‑link**: their scope cannot exceed the lowest CL among their Bridges. When editions change or counter‑examples surface, **lower CL** or change **kind**; if two senses truly converge and invariants match, raise to **CL=3**—rarely, and with reasons. Translate across Contexts; never collapse them.”
