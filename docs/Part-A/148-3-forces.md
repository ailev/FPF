## 3 · Forces (what the definition must balance)

| Force                              | Tension we resolve                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. domain detail** | One Work notion for surgery, welding, ETL, proofs, lab cycles—while letting each keep its vocabulary. |
| **Granularity vs. aggregation**    | Atomic runs vs. composite operations; we need roll‑up without double‑count.                           |
| **Concurrency vs. order**          | Parallel/overlapped activities need clear part/overlap semantics.                                     |
| **Identity vs. retries**           | A failed attempt, a retry, and a resumed episode—what is “the same” work?                             |
| **Time realism vs. simplicity**    | We need intervals and coverage but cannot bury users in temporal logic notation.                      |
