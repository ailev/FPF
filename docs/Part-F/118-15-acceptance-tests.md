## 15 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 15.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F8‑S01 (senseFamily purity).** Every decision record names **one senseFamily**; mixed needs are split.
* **SCR‑F8‑S02 (Proper anchoring).** Every Role Description cites **one SenseCell**; **no row** is used as a assignment/enactment anchor.
* **SCR‑F8‑S03 (Row scope).** Whenever a row is reused, its **Scope** is stated and **Row CL(min) ≥ τ(scope)** holds.
* **SCR‑F8‑S04 (Alias modesty).** Aliases introduced in F.5 do **not** claim new semantics or change senseFamily.
* **SCR‑F8‑S05 (Kernel restraint).** Any new U.Type proposal includes **≥ 3 domain families** of evidence and an **irreducibility** note.

### 15.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F8‑E01 (CL drift).** If any Bridge’s CL changes, re‑evaluate dependent rows; **downgrade or split** where τ(scope) is no longer met.
* **RSCR-F8-E02 (Row overuse).** Scan examples: no case uses **Naming-only** rows to justify **Assignment-eligibility** or **Type-structure** claims.
* **RSCR‑F8‑E03 (Alias creep).** Ensure no Alias has accreted senseFamily‑specific semantics; if it has, migrate to a **row** or **Role Description**.
* **RSCR‑F8‑E04 (Kernel hygiene).** New U.Type proposals are rejected if a **SenseCell + row** construction suffices.
