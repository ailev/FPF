| **Parsimony vs coverage**  | Keep vocabularies small yet expressive across multiple Contexts.         |
| **Locality vs reuse**      | Preserve context‑local meaning while enabling Cross‑context comparison.     |
| **Stability vs evolution** | Allow new editions and rows without erasing prior sense.              |
| **Clarity vs formality**   | Checks must be teachable in minutes yet strong enough to catch drift. |
