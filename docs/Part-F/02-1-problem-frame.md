Trans‑disciplinary modelling fails without an explicit discipline for **where words mean what**.

* **Semantic drift.** The same string (“process”, “role”, “service”) slides between domains and editions.
* **Homonym collisions.** One label carries incompatible senses across fields.
* **Hidden synonymy.** Different labels point to the same local sense, but the identity is unstated.
* **Implicit globalism.** Meaning is treated as universal; integration silently re‑writes models.

FPF resolves this by **localising** meaning first, then **explicitly translating** across locales.
