## 13 · Migration notes (conceptual playbook)

1. **Map to rows.** For each existing Role/Status, identify its **Concept‑Set row**; if two names share an intent, **collapse** to one row (keep other names as **aliases**, F.13).
2. **Extract SoD.** Replace “super‑roles” with **Bundles** plus explicit **SoD**; where conflict exists, SoD is **normative**, not cultural.
3. **Demote modifiers.** Convert adjectival Role types into **U.Facet** (per Compose‑CAL) or **windows** on the base Role.
4. **Window statuses.** Merge Status families split by time/scale into **one Status + windows**; move waived/exempt notions to the **deontic Context** if applicable.
5. **Re‑use before minting.** When encountering a gap, scan rows for a near‑match; only if intent genuinely differs, open a **new row** (F.8).
6. **Preserve continuity.** Keep historic labels as **aliases** under the consolidated template (F.13); do not rewrite past texts.
7. **Rehearse the cut.** After consolidation, you should be able to recite the entire Role/Status vocabulary **from memory**; if not, reduce again.
