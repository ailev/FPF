| You are holding…                          | It is…                         | Why                                           |

| A BPMN diagram or SOP                     | **`U.MethodDescription`**             | A description on a carrier.                   |
| A git repo or compiled binary             | **`U.MethodDescription`**             | Still a description (even if executable).     |
