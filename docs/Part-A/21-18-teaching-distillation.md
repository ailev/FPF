> “Give every action a **badge with a Context**. The badge is a **`U.RoleAssignment`**: `Holder#Role:Context@Window`.
> The badge is **valid** in time (window) and **green** in state (RSG + **StateAssertion**).
> A **Method step** names the badges it needs; a **Work** cites the exact badge that enacted it.
> If a badge comes from another Context, cross with a **Bridge** and respect its **CL penalty**.
> Keep SoD with `⊥`, reuse expertise with `≤`, and require combos with `⊗`.
> Documents don’t act — they hold **status roles**; **only systems enact Work**.
> With this, factories, clouds, and knowledge all speak the same, small grammar.”
