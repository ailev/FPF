## 2 · Scope & Status (Normative)

**Scope.** **C.16** specifies the **measurement substrate** for FPF architheories: the roles of `U.DHCMethodRef`, `U.Measure`, `U.Unit`, `U.EvidenceStub`; their **CSLC discipline**; the notions of **Scale type**, **polarity**, **comparability**, and **evidence sufficiency** at the level of *conceptual conditions*. It **exports** these constructs for all architheories (KD‑CAL, Arch‑CAL, etc.) without prescribing domain formulae or procedures. 

**Status.** **Normative architheory.** C.16 **depends on** A.17 (canonical **Characteristic**) and A.18 (minimal **CSLC** in Kernel). Where C.16 cites external CG‑frames, the stance is through **Part F** rows and **Bridges** (with CL and loss notes), not by vocabulary import. 

**Out of scope.** No computational recipes, no workflow prescriptions, no governance/process guidance. C.16 concerns **objects of thought** (intensions) and their **validity conditions**, not records or tooling. (Implementation guidance, if any, belongs outside Part C.)
