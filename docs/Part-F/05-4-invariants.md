## 4 · Invariants (normative)

1. **I‑1 · Context‑qualified usage.** Every normative use of a term is **Context‑qualified** (directly or via table/section headers).
2. **I‑2 · Local‑only cells.** A SenseCell belongs to **exactly one** Context.
3. **I‑3 · senseFamily hygiene.** SenseCells are **lexical**; behaviour, deontics, measurements, proof steps live in their respective architheories (C‑6). 
4. **I‑4 · Time stance fidelity.** If a source fixes `design/run`, the Context Card **carries** it and SenseCells **inherit** it.
5. **I‑5 · No implicit Cross‑context identity.** Cross‑context relations exist **only** as F.9 Bridges with `relation` and `CL`.
6. **I‑6 · Parsimony & heterogeneity hook.** The Context Map is **finite**, **heterogeneous** (≥ 3 families per unification line), and **parsimonious** (F.1).
