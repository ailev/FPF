## 15 · Migration notes (quick wins for existing texts)

1. **Underline WorkScopes.** For every “can do” sentence, add **conditions** and **measures**; otherwise treat it as background color, not a gate.
2. **Pull thresholds out of roles.** Move “≤ 0.2 mm”, “≥ 0.90 optimality” from role labels into **step requirements**; leave roles clean (assignments).
3. **Pin contexts.** Add the bounded context name to each capability table (“Capability Sheet — AssemblyLine\_2025”).
4. **Snapshot validity.** Add a “valid through” column (software version or calibration horizon).
5. **Separate recipe/execution.** Move flowcharts under **MethodDescription**, runs under **Work**; link the capability to the **holder** with references to those specs.
