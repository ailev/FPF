## 3 · Forces (what we must balance)

| Force                              | Tension we resolve                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. domain idioms** | One plan concept that fits hospitals, fabs, data centers, and research labs—while honoring local terms. |
| **Commitment vs. flexibility**     | Plans must be firm enough to coordinate, yet easy to update as reality changes.                         |
| **Assignment vs. assignment**     | Plans may name intended performers; the actual assignment must still be checked at run time.           |
| **Budgets vs. actuals**            | Plans carry targets and reservations; only Work carries actual spend.                                   |
| **Decomposition vs. mapping**      | Plan tasks decompose conveniently; they do not force a shape on actual Work runs.                       |
