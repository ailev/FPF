## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **New edition appears.** Add a Context in F.1; harvest afresh in F.2 using that Context; do not overwrite earlier units.
2. **Idiomatic update discovered.** If your LNF fought the canon’s idiom, **re‑LNF** within the same context; keep labels/glosses steady unless the canon itself differs.
3. **Ambiguity inside a Context.** If use splits, **mint two units** with distinct glosses; F.3 will sort their relation (same/different Local‑Sense).
4. **Language split.** Treat each language canon as its **own Context**; resist cross‑language merges in F.2.
5. **Tail pruning.** If units accumulate without feeding F.3/F.4/F.9, drop them from the working set; keep head terms that carry bridges.
6. **DSL quarantine.** If a tool dialect is unavoidable, keep it as one context among others; never let it define the idiom for other Contexts.
