## 9 · Invariants (normative)

1. **Locality first.** A Bridge relates **SenseCells**, never Contexts or strings.
2. **senseFamily discipline.** **Substitution Bridges must be senseFamily‑preserving**. **Interpretation Bridges** may cross senseFamilies but **never** license substitution.
3. **Direction clarity.** If the kind is non‑symmetric (⊑/⊒), **state direction** explicitly.
4. **CL honesty.** Assign **CL** only if you can state at least one **counter‑example** (CL≤2) or explain its absence (CL=3).
5. **Loss visibility.** Every Bridge carries **Loss Notes** (even “none”).
6. **Row dependence.** A Concept‑Set row’s **scope** is **bounded by the weakest CL** among its participating Bridges (F.7/F.8).
7. **No senseFamily jump by stealth.** You **must not** use an Interpretation Bridge to justify a **row** or **substitution**.
8. **Time DesignRunTag honesty.** If a Context fixes **design/run**, the Bridge must respect or explicitly declare stance relations (e.g., ⇄ᴅʀ).
9. **Kernel restraint.** Bridges **cannot** be used to promote ad‑hoc sameness into a new **U.Type**; A.11 applies.
10. **Non‑inheritance of Contexts.** Bridges **do not** imply “is‑a” between Contexts (E.10.D1).
