## 7) Rationale & Links (informative)

LEX‑AUTH extends the FPF constitution by **operationalising pattern evolution**: it plugs **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** into **E.9 DRR**, binds **SoTA** via `U.EvidenceRole` and **KD‑CAL**, drives **candidate generation** with **C.18 NQD‑CAL** under **C.19 E/E‑LOG**, enforces **lexical discipline** via **E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE**, and validates with **F.15** regression harnesses. Cross‑context safety is carried by **F.9 Bridges** with **CL penalties** in **B.3 Trust**. The whole remains **notation‑independent** (E.5.2) and stays within the **Core → Tooling → Pedagogy** dependency rule (E.5.3).
