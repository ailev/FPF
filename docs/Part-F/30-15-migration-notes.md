## 15 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **New edition appears.** Keep the old Card; add a new Card with the new edition. If the sense shifts, treat it as a **new Context**; if it is strictly editorial, mark recency but keep one context.
2. **New family emerges.** If a missing family explains recurrent confusion in your line, admit it with **one exemplar** Context; remove a less informative Context to keep parsimony.
3. **Language variants.** Treat language editions as **separate Contexts** unless the canon itself declares a single normative bilingual mapping.
4. **Trip‑wire growth.** When you notice a recurring confusion, add a crisp trip‑wire to the relevant Card (one line; no essays).
5. **Bridges discovered later.** Do not back‑port bridges into F.1; leave the Cards untouched and record the mapping in **F.9**.
6. **Dormant Contexts.** If a Context no longer contributes to any active line, move it to a *parking shelf* (informative note on the Card) rather than deleting it.
