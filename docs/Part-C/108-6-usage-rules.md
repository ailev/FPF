## 6 · **Usage Rules (normative)**

> These are the **only** normative constraints in this pattern. Everything else is guidance.

**AT‑01 (Facet, not Characteristic).** KindAT **SHALL** be treated as a **Facet** per MM‑CHR: it has **no algebra, no thresholds**, and **MUST NOT** appear in guards or composition math.

**AT‑02 (Placement).** If recorded, KindAT **SHALL** be attached to **`U.Kind`** (or its catalog card). It **MUST NOT** be attached to claims/capabilities or used as a proxy for **G**/**F**/**R**.

**AT‑03 (Editorial discipline).** Editors **SHALL NOT** write text implying “higher AT widens scope” or “higher AT increases rigor/reliability.” Any such text **MUST** be revised to reference **ΔG**/**F**/**R** explicitly.

**AT‑04 (Bridge neutrality).** **KindBridge** records **MUST NOT** compute or adjust AT; they may include *informative* remarks about likely anchor alignment. `CL^k` is independent of AT and is assessed from signature/order preservation.

**AT‑05 (Catalog).** Contexts that use AT **SHOULD** record it in **Kind catalog entries** alongside: signature snippet & **F**, subkinds, RoleMasks, KindBridges. Absence of AT implies **“not set”**, not K0.
