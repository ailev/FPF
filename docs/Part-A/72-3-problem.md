## 3 · Problem

1. **Synonym soup.** *Applicability, envelope, generality, capability envelope*—different labels for the **same mechanism** led to mismatches in gating, review, and reuse.
2. **Abstraction confusion.** Calling G “generality” invited teams to treat “more abstract wording” as “broader scope,” silently masking unstated assumptions.
3. **Split mechanics.** Episteme vs system text used different algebra and guard language, though **the same set operations** were meant.
4. **Cross‑context opacity.** Transfers between Contexts lacked a shared carrier and a rule for what changes (trust) vs what stays (scope).
5. **Overloaded words.** *Validity* clashed with **Validation Assurance (LA)**; *operation/operational* clashed with **Work/Run** in A.15, producing governance ambiguity.
