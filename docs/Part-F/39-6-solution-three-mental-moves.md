## 6 · Solution — three mental moves (notation‑free)

### Move A — **Localise the word**

**Question to ask.** *“In which Context am I hearing this word?”*
**Action (mental).** Point to a specific **Context** (from F.1). Grab 1–2 **attested phrases** that are representative **in this Context**.
**Outcome.** You stop thinking “global word” and start thinking “context‑local usage”.

*Micro‑cue.* If you cannot name the Context, do not harvest the word.

### Move B — **Name it in the Context’s idiom**

**Question to ask.** *“How would this Context itself write it?”*
**Action (mental).** Choose the **LNF** (Context‑conformant spelling/hyphenation). Then write the **two‑register label** and a **one‑sentence gloss** that says **what the canon means here**—nothing more.
**Outcome.** You have a **local lexical unit** *(Context, LNF, Tech, Plain, Gloss)*.

*Micro‑cues.*
• Prefer the canon’s head noun; keep canonical hyphens; avoid invented compounds.
• The **Plain** label should help a non‑specialist; the **Tech** label should match engineers’ eyes.
• The **Gloss** must fit on a single line; defer details to F.3.

### Move C — **Fence it off**

**Question to ask.** *“What must I refuse to conclude here?”*
**Action (mental).** Explicitly **refuse** to: (1) compare across Contexts, (2) fold morphology that the canon treats as meaningful, (3) embed behaviour, deontics, or type structure.
**Outcome.** A clean, **context‑local** lexical unit that will be safe to cluster in F.3 and safe to bridge (or not) in F.9.
