## 10 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern               | Symptom in thought                                                            | Why it harms                                            | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                          |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **String = Sense**         | Treating surface identity (*service*, *SLO*) as sameness of meaning.          | Collapses distinct uses; hides selectional differences. | Compare **selectional frames** and entailments inside the Context; merge only if conclusions never diverge.          |
| **A2**  | **Cross‑context creep**       | Folding BPMN *process* with PROV *activity* while clustering **inside** BPMN. | Imports foreign usage; violates locality.               | Constrain attention to **one context**; postpone Cross‑context talk to F.9.                                             |
| **A3**  | **Over‑granulation**       | Splitting minor orthographic variants (*service‑level‑objective* vs *SLO*).   | Adds friction; no conceptual gain.                      | Consolidate **canon‑blessed aliases** into one Local‑Sense.                                                       |
| **A4**  | **Under‑granulation**      | One sense for incompatible roles (*event* as node‑type vs occurrence).        | Causes contradictory inferences later.                  | Split on **role/entailment** conflict; add a **counter‑example** to sharpen the cut.                              |
| **A5**  | **Imported definitions**   | Borrowing dictionary glosses not used in the canon.                           | Drifts from the Context’s idiom; confuses labels.          | Ground every sense line in **statements the canon actually makes**.                                               |
| **A6**  | **Label drift**            | Tech label in canon idiom; Plain label broadens scope.                        | Teaches the wrong thing; leaks meaning.                 | Keep **Tech** idiomatic; make **Plain** helpful yet strictly **within** the same usage.                           |
| **A7**  | **Behaviour/math leakage** | Sense lines include runtime metrics, deontic rules, type axioms.              | Mixes I/D/S layers; duplicates Part C work.                   | Sense lines are **usage‑only**; no equations, no policies.                                                        |
| **A8**  | **Edition blend**          | Mixing 2011 and 2020 usage under one Local‑Sense.                             | Hidden shifts; brittle bridges later.                   | If usage changed with edition, treat as **different Contexts** (F.1) or distinct Local‑Senses with **edition note**. |
| **A9**  | **Collocate worship**      | Declaring sameness solely from similar nearby words.                          | Correlates ≠ causes; misses entailments.                | Use collocates as **cues**, then decide by **entailment/role** checks.                                            |
| **A10** | **Temporal fudge**         | Treating a design‑time sense as if it were run‑time (or vice versa).          | Category errors at enactment.                           | Respect the Context’s **time stance**; keep senses aligned to *design* or *run* as declared in F.1.                  |
