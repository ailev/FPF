## 2 · Problem frame

1. **Plan ≠ proof.** Diagrams and playbooks are treated as if they demonstrated fulfilment.
2. **Signal ≠ outcome.** Control signals (Actuation) are mistaken for the service outcome experienced by the consumer.
3. **Global meanings.** *Availability*, *incident*, *latency* are used as if universal, ignoring context‑local senses.
4. **Unstated translation.** Metrics from one canon are mapped to clauses from another without declaring losses.
5. **Timeless verdicts.** Judgements are asserted with no explicit Window (day, month, batch).
