Without a modality‑aware mapping of statuses:

* **Homonym traps.** *Validated* in metrology ≠ *validated* in software QA; *approved* in a standard ≠ *compliant* to a requirement.
* **Design/run bleed.** Design‑time “approved method” is used as if it proved run‑time “meets SLO”.
* **False substitution.** *Observed availability 99.95%* is silently treated as *SLO satisfied* without declaring the translation.
* **Name inflation.** New U.Types minted to stabilise drifting status words instead of fixing Contexts and Bridges.
