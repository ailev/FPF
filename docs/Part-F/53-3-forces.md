| Force                     | Tension to resolve                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs fidelity** | Few Local‑Senses ease teaching; too few dilute real distinctions the canon relies on.                            |
| **Usage vs definition**   | Glosses should reflect **how the canon uses the word**, not an imported dictionary definition.                   |
| **Labels vs idiom**       | Tech label must stay in the canon’s idiom; Plain label must help newcomers—without inventing a new sense.        |
| **Stability vs openness** | Consolidated senses must be stable enough for Role Descriptions and tables, yet revisable when the canon’s use clearly splits. |
