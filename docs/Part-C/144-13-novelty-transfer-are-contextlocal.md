## 13 · Novelty & transfer are **context‑local** (Bridges mandatory)

**Rule N‑1 (Locality).** `Novelty@context` is defined **only** within its `U.BoundedContext`. **Never** compare scores across Contexts without an **Alignment Bridge** (F.9).

**Rule N‑2 (Directional mapping).** A Bridge may assert a **directional** substitution (e.g., *Novelty\@DesignLab → Novelty\@Manufacturing* with CL = 2, **loss:** aesthetics encoder absent). Reverse mapping is **not** implied.

**Rule N‑3 (Penalty to R, not to G).** Cross‑context novelty **does not** change scope **G**; it **reduces R** (reliability) by the **CL penalty** (B.3), unless validated by pilot Work in the target Context.

**Practical pattern.** Publish novelty **with its Context tag** and—when reused—attach the **Bridge id** and target‑context **pilot** outcomes.
