## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **New status word appears.** Treat it as a **StatusCell** in its Context; place it on the local ladder; only then consider Bridges.
2. **Edition changes.** If a Context redefines a status, **fork the StatusCell** (new SenseCell) and relate old↔new via a **Bridge** (often ⊑/⊒ with Loss).
3. **Threshold tuning.** The project sets **θ** (minimum CL for substitution). Lowering θ widens reuse but increases risk; document the choice in F.7 terms.
4. **Clause redesign.** If a requirement clause changes, keep old **Windows** intact; new clause starts a new Target; do **not** rewrite history.
5. **Explode→compress.** When many bespoke tool statuses pile up, **map** them to the nearest ladder level in their Contexts; keep tool labels as **Naming‑only**.
6. **Bridge hardening.** If explanation Bridges are used frequently, reconsider experiments that could raise **CL** enough to permit substitution—or accept explanation as sufficient and stop short of substitution.
