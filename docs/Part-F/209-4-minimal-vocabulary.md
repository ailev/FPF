## 4 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Role Description** (F.4): a **Role** (behavioural mask) or **Status** (epistemic/deontic standing) tied to a **SenseCell**.
* **Concept‑Set row** (F.7): a Cross‑context **intent** (“what we count as one thing”) aligned by SenseCells.
* **Bundle** (this pattern): a **named composition** of Role Descriptions that are meant to be used together by design (e.g., {Requester, Approver} for change control). A Bundle is a **concept**, not a package.
* **SoD Constraint** (this pattern): a **conceptual rule** stating that two Roles **must not** be played by the same Holder in the **same window**.
* **Window** (F.10): an **claim scope** (time stance, holon level, run segment) that delimits when a Role/Status holds.
