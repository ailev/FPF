## 16 · Rationale (why this specific design)

* **Strict Distinction (A.7).** Keeps **identity** (Holon) separate from **assignment** (RoleAssignment), **behaviour** (Method/Work), and **knowledge** (Episteme).
* **Ontological Parsimony (A.11).** One universal binding, three tiny in‑Context relations (`≤, ⊥, ⊗`), no global role types.
* **Universal Core (A.8).** Same mechanism works across **systems** (machines, software, teams) and **epistemes** (standards, requirements), demonstrated in §9.
* **Lexical discipline (E.10.D1 & E.10.D2).** Roles are **context‑local**; descriptions (RCS, RSG) are **descriptions of intensional roles**, not the roles themselves.
* **Alignment with SoTA.**

  * **DDD.** Elevates **Bounded Context** from software to a universal meaning frame.
  * **UFO / OntoUML.** Roles as anti‑rigid, context‑dependent types.
  * **OMG Essence.** RSG generalises Alpha state graphs with explicit checklists and enactability flags.
  * **RBAC & Assurance.** First‑class SoD and auditable windows; CL penalties match modern safety/security practice.
  * **PROV‑O.** Clean separation of Activity (Work) from Association (who held which role).
