## 15 · Didactic quick cards

* **What is Work?** *How it went this time* → dated, resourced, accountable.
* **Four‑slot grammar:** Who? **RoleAssigning**. Can? **Capability**. How? **Method/MethodDescription**. Did? **Work**.
* **CAC checks:** **Context** (judgement), **assignment** (valid RoleAssigning), **Standard** (acceptance criteria).
* **Roll‑ups:** `Γ_time = union` (utilization) or `hull` (lead time); `Γ_work` with a declared overlap policy.
* **Episodes vs retries:** same run split vs new run; write the policy.
* **Resource honesty:** actuals booked **only** to Work; estimates live in specs.
