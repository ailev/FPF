## 10 · Time and change (calibration, drift, upgrades)

Capabilities are **stable but not static**. Three simple practices keep reasoning honest:

* **Qualification windows.** Abilities drift. Put a **QualificationWindow** on the statement (e.g., “valid for software v4.2; recalibration due 2025-09-30”).
* **Change points.** Note upgrades/downgrades that affect the WorkScope or measures.
* **Snapshot at execution.** When Work is recorded, it is implicitly tied to the **then‑current** capability statement; later edits do not rewrite history (see CC‑A2.2‑6).

**Manager’s rule of thumb:** if you would reschedule a job after a tool change, the capability statement needs a new window.
