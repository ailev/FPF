| **Universality vs locality** | We want cross‑domain unification, but **meaning is local** to a U.BoundedContext. |
| **Breadth vs parsimony**     | Wide coverage prevents bias; too many Contexts defeats understanding.                |
| **Recency vs continuity**    | New editions matter; but working knowledge often trails by years.                 |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**    | Pedagogically simple summaries must remain faithful to the source.                |
