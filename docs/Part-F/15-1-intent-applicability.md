## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Establish a **finite set of U.BoundedContext** (“**context of meaning**”), each tied to an authoritative source or canon within a **domain family**, so that all later moves (term harvesting, clustering, role naming, cross‑context bridges) operate on **local meanings** rather than on drifting, globalised words.

**Applicability.** Use **at the start** of any unification effort for **any architheory** (Enactment (`U.RoleAssignment` + `U.RoleEnactment`), Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, LCA-CAL…) and **whenever** a discipline canon materially changes (new edition, re-framing, seminal result).

**Non‑goals.** No tooling, workflow, or editorial roles. No global ontology. No cross‑context equations. This pattern describes **how to think**, not how to store.
