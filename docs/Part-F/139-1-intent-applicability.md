## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **simple, Context‑first way** to express and compare **status meanings** across disciplines **without collapsing modalities** (*epistemic* vs *deontic*). We focus on three pervasive **status families**:

1. **EvidenceStatus** (what the world **shows**) — epistemic modality.
2. **StandardStatus** (what a canon **sanctions**) — deontic (curatorial) modality.
3. **RequirementStatus** (what an obligation is **doing**) — deontic (compliance) modality.

Each status meaning is **local to a Context** (`U.BoundedContext`). Cross‑context relationships appear **only** via **Bridges** (F.9) with a declared **kind** and **CL** (congruence level).

**Applicability.** Whenever models mix observations, standards, and obligations: service acceptance from uptime measurements; safety proofs against normative checklists; ML model “validated” vs “approved for use”.

**Non‑goals.** No workflows, no tool states, no editorial lifecycles. This pattern defines **conceptual meaning and safe reasoning moves**, not procedures.
