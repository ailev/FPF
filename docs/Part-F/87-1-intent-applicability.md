## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **single, didactic page** where each **row** presents **one Concept‑Set**—a *set of SenseCells from different Contexts that we are licensed (by explicit Bridges) to treat as “the same for a stated scope”*. Columns are **Contexts**; cells carry **local labels**. The table **does not invent equivalences**: it **summarises** already declared **F.9 Bridges**, exposing *scope, losses, and counter‑examples* at a glance.

**Applicability.** Use whenever cross-context reading is necessary (naming U.Types, teaching contrasts, assignment/enactment-adjacent terminology). It is a **reading lens**, not a data model: **notation-free**, **governance-free**, **Context-loyal**.

**Non‑goals.** No hidden merges. No “global terms”. No workflows or tool schemas. The table is a **conceptual display** of *licensed sameness* and *honest non‑sameness*.
