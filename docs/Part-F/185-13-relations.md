## 13 · Relations (with other patterns)

* **Builds on:**
  **F.1** (Contexts): keeps all meanings **local**.
  **F.2–F.3**: provide the **SenseCells** that become Clause/Work/Measure anchors.
  **F.5**: ensures labels for Clause/Work/Measure and Windows are didactically clear.
  **F.7–F.9**: supply **Bridge** kinds / **CL** and loss semantics.
  **F.10**: defines **Status** families and **Window** constructs.
  **F.11**: protects **Method / MethodDescription / Work / Actuation** distinctions.

* **Uses (Part C architheories).**
  **KD‑CAL** (Observation/Characteristic/Scale/Unit).
  **Sys‑CAL** (Work/Actuation Contexts).
  **Kind-CAL** (type labels for populations or cohort selection).

* **Constrains:**
  Later reporting and assurance rules (B.3) must **not** collapse CL/Loss; they report them alongside status.
