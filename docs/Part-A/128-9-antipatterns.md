## 9 · Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **“Dynamics = procedure.”**
  Control recipes/step graphs belong to `Method/MethodDescription`. Keep the law in `U.Dynamics`.

* **“Telemetry = dynamics.”**
  Logs are `Work` evidence. Build `trace(Work, D)` and compare to the law; do not store logs inside the law.

* **“No state space.”**
  KPI lists without an explicit `stateSpace` turn into dashboard folklore. Name characteristics with units and ranges.

* **“Hard‑coding SLO inside the law.”**
  Service targets are promises (`U.Service.acceptanceSpec`). Keep predictions and promises separate; link them.

* **“Stuffing Dynamics into BoM.”**
  A model is not a component. Leave PBS/SBS for structure.

* **“One size fits all time base.”**
  If parts of the system evolve on different clocks, declare `hybrid` and separate update rules.
