# C.2 · **KD‑CAL** — *Epistemic holon composition* \[A]  *(Architheory: CAL)*

**Scope & exports.** A substrate‑neutral calculus for composing **epistemic holons** (`U.Episteme`) and reasoning about their motion and equivalence. Exports: (i) three **point‑characteristics**—**Formality F**, **ClaimScope G**, **Reliability R**—that locate a single episteme; (ii) a **pairwise ladder** of **Congruence Levels (CL 0…3)**; (iii) four **Δ‑moves** (*Formalise, Generalise/Specialise, Calibrate/Validate, Congrue*); (iv) **composition rules** (Γ_epist) for aggregates; (v) propagation laws for CL through mappings and notation bridges. KD‑CAL sits on the `U.Episteme` *semantic triangle* (Symbol–Concept–Object) and never confuses **notation** with **carrier**. All F–G–R computations are **context‑local**; Cross‑context traversals **require** an explicit **Bridge** with **CL** and apply the **B.3** congruence penalty **Φ(CL)** to **R**.  // Contexts ≡ U.BoundedContext; substitution is plane‑preserving only.

**Formality F** is the rigor characteristic defined **normatively in C.2.3**. All KD‑CAL computations and guards **SHALL** use `U.Formality` (F0…F9) as specified there; **no parallel “mode” ladders** are allowed.

## C.2.1 · **U.Episteme — Epistemes and their slot graph** \[A]

> **One-line summary.** `U.Episteme` is the holon type for epistemes; its internal ontology is given by `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`, which replaces the legacy **semantic triangle** with a typed graph n-ary relation over `DescribedEntity`, `GroundingHolon`, `ClaimGraph`, `Viewpoint`, `View`, and `ReferenceScheme`, aligned with `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` and ready for both symbolic and distributed representations.

### 1 · Context

FPF’s kernel recognises two archetypal sub‑holons: **System** and **Episteme**. Systems are operational wholes; **epistemes** are **knowledge holons**—theories, models, specifications, standards, algorithms, proofs—whose reason for being is to **say something defeasible or deductive about something** and to be **held to account** by justification. 

**Readers.** Engineering managers and lead designers who need a uniform way to reason about **theories, specifications, algorithms, proofs**—from charter memos up to formal axiomatics—without collapsing into tooling or discipline‑specific notations.

KD‑CAL (C.2) needs a precise notion of **what an episteme is** and **how it mediates** between:

* the thing(s) it is about,
* the contexts and systems that ground and test it, and
* the representational machinery (notations, carriers, operations) we use to work with it.

Contemporary work on **formal languages as cognitive artifacts** (Dutilh Novaes), **operational iconicity** of notations (Krӓmer), **material engagement** (Malafouris), **distributed representations** and **latent‑space communication** in ML, and **tool‑augmented reasoning** (ReAct‑style agent loops) shows that:
* the relation between an episteme and its **DescribedEntitySlot** is not a single “Object-vertex”: it involves explicit **slots and morphisms** (described-entity mapping, grounding, evaluation) typed by SlotKinds and contexts;
* **representations** come in heterogeneous forms (symbolic, diagrammatic, latent, interactive), with very different **operational affordances**;
* **inference** is often **mixed‑mode**: symbolic reasoning plus calls to tools, solvers, and learned models.

FPF therefore needs a **more modular, graph‑shaped ontology** for epistemes which:
* keeps **KD‑CAL** and I/D/S discipline intact,
* is compatible with **A.6.0/A.6.5** signatures (`SlotKind`/`ValueKind`/`RefKind`),
* can be used uniformly by A.6.2–A.6.4 (epistemic morphisms) and E.17.* (views & publication),
* and demotes the old non-SoTA **semanit triangle** to a **didactic projection**, not the normative ontology.

In this pattern:+
* `U.Episteme` is the **holon genus** for epistemes (C.2), with components and identity governed by A.1/A.6/A.7.
* `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` names the **internal ontology graph** of `U.Episteme`: the small, typed n-ary relation over episteme positions (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) on which KD-CAL, A.6.2–A.6.4 and E.17.* rely.
* Species such as `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, `U.EpistemePublication` are holonic realisations of `U.Episteme` whose component structure is constrained to be compatible with `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.

### 2 · Problem

Without a shared **episteme constitution**, teams fall into recurring failure modes:

1. **Object–Description–Carrier soup.** Diagrams and files are treated as *the theory itself*. Changes to a PDF are confused with theoretical change.
2. **DescribedObject blur.** A spec seems to describe “everything in general”. The **GroundingHolon**—*what exactly this knowledge is about*—is implicit and drifts.
3. **Proof vs program confusion.** Algorithms, specifications, and proofs are mixed: a “proof” is used as if it were a tested routine; a “program” is cited as if it entailed a theorem (Curry–Howard misunderstood).
4. **Unanchored trust.** Claims accumulate with no explicit **justification graph** or **evidence freshness**, so assurance degrades invisibly.
5. **Category errors at execution.** Epistemes appear as *actors* (“the standard enforces…”) instead of **systems** acting *with* or *on* epistemes such as data sets or algorithms.

The legacy non-SoTA “Semantic Triangle” treated an episteme as a holon with three components: **Concept** (ClaimGraph), **Object** (Reference Map), and **Symbol** (notation).

This worked well for:
* separating **meaning** (Concept) from **carriers**, and
* integrating KD‑CAL’s **F–G–R** characteristics (Formality, ClaimScope, Reliability).

But for current use‑cases it has structural blind spots:

1. **No explicit DescribedEntity slot.**
   The “Object vertex” bundles together *what the episteme is about* with *how we interpret and test it*. There is no explicit **slot** for the entity‑of‑interest (`U.Entity`) and no clear separation between:
   * the **thing described**, and
   * the **ReferenceScheme** used to read claims as statements about that thing.

2. **Grounding collapses into Object.**
   Material and organisational contexts (labs, infrastructures, organisations) that **ground** an episteme (in Malafouris’ sense) are hidden in the Object/Reference Map. KD‑CAL and Bridges need explicit **GroundingHolon** positions.

3. **Viewpoints are not first‑class.**
   ISO‑style **viewpoints** (families of stakeholders, concerns, conformance rules) and their induced **views** appear only indirectly, via KD‑CAL or MVPK. There is no explicit `U.Viewpoint` / `U.View` pair at the episteme core, which makes it hard to:

   * connect to I/D/S **DescriptionContext**,
   * organize multi‑view descriptions (E.17.0), or
   * align publication viewpoints with engineering viewpoints.

4. **Representations and operations are compressed into “Symbol”.**
   Very different representational regimes are flattened into one Symbol vertex:

   * purely denotational notations (no internal inference calculus),
   * fully operational calculi (e.g., proof assistants),
   * interactive visualisations,
   * latent vectors and prompt‑programs for LLMs.
     There is no place to say “this representation admits **syntactic inference** of such‑and‑such kind” vs “this is just a **passive label**”.

5. **No explicit signature discipline.**
   The triangle speaks of “Object/Concept/Symbol” but not of **slots** and **references** in the sense of A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`. In episteme this leads to:
   * names where **slot, value and ref** are conflated (`DescribedEntityRef` used as if it were a slot),
   * ambiguity between “epistemic object” (what is talked about) and “episteme” (the description),
   * fragile interoperability with signatures for roles, methods, services.

Thus we have problems of:
* **DescribedEntity drift.**
 Specifications and models accumulate without a stable notion of **which DescribedEntity they talk about**; fields like `SubjectRef` are overloaded and resist safe refactoring.
* **Viewpoint confusion.**
  Engineering, publication and governance views are mixed, making it hard to maintain consistency across surfaces or to reason about conformity of descriptions under different viewpoints.
* **Representation mismatches.**
  Trade‑offs between neural vs symbolic, diagrammatic vs textual, or interactive vs batch representations cannot be expressed at the episteme level; they leak into ad‑hoc tool descriptions.
* **Broken modularity.**
  As soon as we add KD‑CAL, LOG‑CAL, MVPK, and E.TGA, multiple **implicit triangles** appear, each with slightly different semantics, instead of a single shared `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.

We need a replacement for the triangle that keeps its **didactic clarity** but matches the **graph‑ and morphism‑centric** reality of contemporary epistemic work.

### 4 · Solution — from outdated semantic triangle to `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`

#### 4.0 Overview

For `U.Episteme`, the legacy semantic triangle is replaced by `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` that is a **small, typed ontology graph** and an **n-ary relation view** over the core episteme positions:

 **Nodes / positions / slots.**
  Minimal **kernel SlotKinds** (with their ValueKinds) that every episteme can refer to, following A.6.5:
  * `DescribedEntitySlot`  (ValueKind `U.Entity` or a declared subkind) → *“what this episteme is about”*;
  * `GroundingHolonSlot`   (ValueKind `U.Holon`) → *“where/how this is grounded”*;
  * `ClaimGraphSlot`       (ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`) → *“what is being said (intensional content)”*;
  * `ReferenceSchemeSlot`  (ValueKind `U.ReferenceScheme`) → *“how we read claims as statements about entities”*;
  * `ViewpointSlot`        (ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`) → *“under which viewpoint we read/validate this episteme”*;
  * `ViewSlot`             (ValueKind `U.View`) → *“a view‑episteme produced under a viewpoint”*.

* **Slots and signatures.**
  These positions are realised as **SlotKinds** with associated **ValueKinds** and **RefKinds** under `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` (A.6.5). An **episteme kind** (`U.EpistemeKind`) is a **signature** over these slots.

* **Episteme as n‑ary relation and as holon.**
  Each concrete episteme instance can be seen both as:

  * a **tuple** filling these slots (`U.EpistemeTuple`), and
  * a **holon with components** (`U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, `U.EpistemePublication`) whose fields correspond to those slots.

`U.Episteme` is thus the holon type whose components are *disciplined* by the `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`; C.2.1 fixes that discipline.

* **Morphisms.**
  Simple **epistemic morphisms** (described-entity mapping, grounding, encoding, evaluation) are expressed as ordinary relations/functions between these positions. A.6.2–A.6.4 then specify general laws for effect-free morphisms over `U.Episteme`.

* **Legacy triangle as didactic projection.**
  The classic Symbol–Concept–Object triangle becomes a **didactic view** of this graph, not the normative ontology; it is simply the projection to:

  * `Symbol` ≈ a subset of `U.RepresentationScheme`/`U.RepresentationToken`,
  * `Concept` ≈ `U.ClaimGraph`,
  * `Object` ≈ `{DescribedEntity, ReferenceScheme}`.

The rest of this pattern fixes the **minimal core** needed by KD‑CAL, A.6.2–A.6.4 and E.17.*. The representational nodes (`U.RepresentationScheme`, `U.RepresentationToken`, `U.PresentationCarrier`, `U.RepresentationOperation`) are introduced as an **extension C.2.1+**, preserving the interface defined here.

#### 4.1 Minimal epistemic positions (nodes & slots)

This section defines the **minimal node set** for `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` and the associated **SlotKinds**. These are the positions that A.6.2–A.6.4 and E.17.* can rely on.

##### 4.1.1 `DescribedEntitySlot` — “what this episteme is about”

**Tech:** `DescribedEntitySlot` (SlotKind), `describedEntityRef : U.EntityRef` (Ref slot in tuples/cards).
**Plain:** *described entity*, *entity‑of‑interest*, *object‑of‑talk*.

**Intent.** Provide a **single, explicit slot** for the entity (or entities) that an episteme is about, avoiding the former conflation of Object/Reference/Context.

**Normative definition.**

1. `DescribedEntitySlot` is a **SlotKind** in the sense of A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`.

   * Its **ValueKind** is `U.Entity`.
   * Its **RefKind** is `U.EntityRef` (or a species thereof) and **MUST** be realised in data as a field named `describedEntityRef : U.EntityRef` (E.10 discipline).
1. Species of `U.EpistemeKind` **MAY** constrain the ValueKind to a subtype `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` (for example, “EoI is always a `U.Holon` and, more specifically, a `U.System` or `U.Episteme`”). The subtype **MUST NOT** be named `U.DescribedEntity`; “described entity” remains a **role name**, not a kernel type.
2. Wherever episteme previously used `U.EpistemicObject` as a separate type, it is re‑interpreted as **“`U.Entity` in the role of filling `DescribedEntitySlot`”** and is marked as **legacy alias** in LEX‑BUNDLE.

**Didactic cue.**
“Ask: *What, exactly, is this description about?* That is the DescribedEntity.”

##### 4.1.2 `GroundingHolonSlot` — “where / in what holon this is grounded”

**Tech:** `GroundingHolonSlot` (SlotKind), `groundingHolonRef : U.HolonRef?`.
**Plain:** *grounding holon*, *holon‑of‑grounding*, *engagement context*.

**Intent.** Capture the **material–social holon** (system, lab, infrastructure, organisation, runtime environment) with respect to which an episteme’s claims are **tested, calibrated or validated**.

**Normative definition.**

1. `GroundingHolonSlot` is a **SlotKind** with:

   * **ValueKind** `U.Holon`,
   * **RefKind** `U.HolonRef` (or a species thereof),
   * and recommended field name `groundingHolonRef? : U.HolonRef` in episteme cards/views.
2. `GroundingHolonSlot` is **optional** at the minimal core: an episteme may be **un‑grounded** at M‑mode (e.g., purely mathematical), but any episteme used for **empirical evaluation or assurance** under KD‑CAL **SHALL** either:

   * populate `groundingHolonRef`, or
   * declare explicitly that no such grounding is possible (e.g., counterfactuals, abstract logics), with consequences reflected in KD‑CAL `R`.
3. The phrase *“grounding holon”* is **plain‑register**; there is no kernel type `U.GroundingHolon`. It always means “the holon currently filling `GroundingHolonSlot` for this episteme.”

**Didactic cue.**
“Ask: *In which lab/organisation/world‑slice do we test or observe this?* That is the GroundingHolon.”

##### 4.1.3 `U.ClaimGraph` and `ClaimGraphSlot` — intensional content

**Tech:** `U.ClaimGraph` (kernel type), `ClaimGraphSlot` (SlotKind).
**Plain:** *claim graph*, *intensional content*.

**Intent.** Reuse the existing KD‑CAL notion of **ClaimGraph** as the episteme’s **intensional body**, but make its role as a **slot value** explicit.

**Normative definition.**

1. `U.ClaimGraph` is the **ValueKind** for `ClaimGraphSlot`:

   * nodes: typed claims (definitions, axioms, theorems, requirements, properties, assumptions);
   * edges: logical/derivational/refinement relations, as already defined in C.2.
2. `ClaimGraphSlot` is a **SlotKind** whose instances are always **stored by value** in core patterns:

   * `content : U.ClaimGraph` is the normative field in `U.EpistemeCard` / `U.EpistemeView`;
   * C.2.1 **MUST NOT** introduce `U.ClaimGraphRef` as a ValueKind. Any reference type for ClaimGraphs, if needed, is a **RefKind** defined by discipline packs on top of `U.ClaimGraph`.
3. `ClaimGraphSlot` is **mandatory**: every `U.EpistemeKind` that uses C.2.1 **SHALL** have exactly one `ClaimGraphSlot`.

**Didactic cue.**
“Ask: *What is actually being claimed, defined, required, proved?* That is the ClaimGraph.”

##### 4.1.4 `U.Viewpoint` and `ViewpointSlot` — perspective of concerns and validators

**Tech:** `U.Viewpoint` (kernel type), `ViewpointSlot` (SlotKind), `viewpointRef : U.ViewpointRef?`.
**Plain:** *viewpoint*, *perspective*, *stakeholder perspective*.

**Intent.** Provide a **first‑class home** for ISO‑style viewpoints and their generalisations, as used by E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`, MVPK, and TEVB.

**Normative definition.**

1. `U.Viewpoint` is the type of **intensional viewpoint specifications**:

   * families of **RoleEnactors/stakeholder groups** the viewpoint speaks for,
   * their **concerns**,
   * allowed **kinds of descriptions/specifications**,
   * and **conformance rules** for views under this viewpoint.
     (The internal structure of `U.Viewpoint` is fixed in E.17.0, not here.)
2. `ViewpointSlot` is a **SlotKind** with:

   * **ValueKind** `U.Viewpoint`,
   * **RefKind** `U.ViewpointRef`,
   * normative field name `viewpointRef? : U.ViewpointRef` on episteme cards/views.
3. For **I/D/S descriptions/specs** (E.10.D2), `viewpointRef` is a **mandatory part of `DescriptionContext`**; C.2.1 treats that as a **species‑level constraint**, not as a universal requirement for all epistemes.
4. `ViewpointSlot` may be unset in purely internal, pre‑viewpoint epistemes (e.g., raw formal developments), but any episteme that participates in **MultiViewDescribing** (E.17.0) **MUST** set it or be deterministically associated to it via a `ViewpointBundle`.

**Didactic cue.**
“Ask: *Who is this for, and what do they need to see to accept it?* That is the Viewpoint.”

##### 4.1.5 `U.EpistemeView` / `U.View` and `ViewSlot` — episteme‑level views

**Tech:** `U.EpistemeView` (kernel species of `U.Episteme`), alias `U.View`; `ViewSlot` (SlotKind); `viewRef : U.ViewRef`.
**Plain:** *view*, *epistemic view*.

**Intent.** Distinguish **view‑epistemes** (views **of** descriptions/specifications) from both:

* the underlying descriptions/specifications themselves, and
* the **PublicationSurface** carriers on which they are rendered (E.17, L‑SURF).

**Normative definition.**

1. `U.EpistemeView` is a **species of `U.Episteme`** whose episteme kind includes, at minimum:

   * one `ClaimGraphSlot` (typically a **sliced or projected ClaimGraph**),
   * one `DescribedEntitySlot`,
   * one `ViewpointSlot`,
   * and appropriate `ReferenceSchemeSlot`.
2. `U.View` is an **alias** for `U.EpistemeView` in E‑cluster patterns (especially E.17.*), used where the word “view” is conventional.
3. `ViewSlot` is a **SlotKind** whose:

   * **ValueKind** is `U.View`,
   * **RefKind** is `U.ViewRef` (or `U.EpistemeViewRef` species),
   * intended usage is **in meta‑structures** such as `U.MultiViewDescribing` families and MVPK.
4. `ViewSlot` **MUST NOT** be confused with carrier slots: Surfaces and faces are **not** values of `ViewSlot`; they are `U.Surface` artefacts in L‑SURF, related to views by MVPK.

**Didactic cue.**
“Ask: *Which particular slice of the description under this viewpoint are we talking about?* That is the View.”

##### 4.1.6 `U.ReferenceScheme` and `ReferenceSchemeSlot` — reading ClaimGraph as claims about entities

**Tech:** `U.ReferenceScheme` (kernel type), `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (SlotKind); `referenceScheme? : U.ReferenceScheme`.
**Plain:** *reference scheme*, *interpretation scheme*, *description scheme*.

**Intent.** Separate **what is being said** (ClaimGraph) from **how claims are read as statements about entities and contexts** (designation, measurement, evaluation envelopes), without reifying the referents themselves as a vertex.

**Normative definition.**

1. `U.ReferenceScheme` is a **component type of epistemes**, not an external object:

   * it determines how nodes of `U.ClaimGraph` are mapped to **properties/relations** over values of `DescribedEntitySlot`,
   * it specifies **measurement/evaluation templates** (how to test claims on `GroundingHolon`),
   * it fixes **claim scope envelopes** over characteristic spaces.
2. `ReferenceSchemeSlot` is a **SlotKind** with:

   * **ValueKind** `U.ReferenceScheme`,
   * **no RefKind in the minimal core** (ReferenceSchemes are stored by value as `referenceScheme? : U.ReferenceScheme` fields on episteme cards/views).
     Discipline packs **may** introduce `U.ReferenceSchemeRef` as a **RefKind**, but **must not** repurpose it as a new ValueKind.
3. `ReferenceScheme` is the place where the legacy “Object‑vertex” semantics now live:

   * it does **not** “contain” the real‑world object,
   * it hosts the **rules** that tie claims to entities and groundings.

**Didactic cue.**
“Ask: *Given this ClaimGraph, how exactly do we treat it as talking about these entities in these contexts, and how do we test it?* That is the ReferenceScheme.”

##### 4.1.7 Minimal node set and extension C.2.1+

The **minimal `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` core** for C.2.1 consists of positions (the episteme core SlotKinds of A.6.5 CC‑A.6.5‑5):
* `DescribedEntitySlot` (ValueKind `U.Entity`),
* `GroundingHolonSlot` (ValueKind `U.Holon`),
* `ClaimGraphSlot` (ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`),
* `ViewpointSlot` (ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`),
* `ViewSlot` (ValueKind `U.View`),
* `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (ValueKind `U.ReferenceScheme`).

This pattern **only fixes these positions**.
The **extension C.2.1+** (second step of the refactor) adds:
* `U.RepresentationScheme` and `RepresentationSchemeSlot`,
* `U.RepresentationToken` and `RepresentationTokenSlot`,
* `U.PresentationCarrier` and `PresentationCarrierSlot`,
* `U.RepresentationOperation` and `RepresentationOperationSlot` (with inference regime annotations),

without changing:
* the definition of `U.EpistemeKind`,
* the minimal `U.EpistemeCard` interface,
* or the assumptions A.6.2–A.6.4 / E.17.* make about episteme components.

In C.2.1+ carriers remain **structural publication artefacts**, not semantic parts of the episteme:
`U.PresentationCarrier` values are linked to `U.Episteme` / `U.View` via MVPK / L‑SURF relations (e.g. `isCarriedBy` / faces) and **MUST NOT** be counted as components when reasoning about episteme identity, DescribedEntity/grounding, or KD‑CAL morphisms. Changing carriers or surfaces alone **never** changes the `U.Episteme` instance determined by C.2.1; it only produces new `U.Work` / publication events.

##### 4.1.8 Attached epistemic structures (non-slot components)

`U.EpistemeSlotGraph` deliberately does **not** reify every epistemic artefact as a node. Several key structures remain **attached, non-slot components** of `U.Episteme`:
* **`JustificationGraph`** — the argument/evidence graph for nodes of `U.ClaimGraph` (A.10/B.3).
* **`EvidenceBindings`** — per-claim `U.EvidenceRole` assignments that connect claims to external `U.Work` and carriers.
* **`EditionSeries`** — the `PhaseOf` chain of episteme editions (A.14) with change-class annotations (symbol-only vs ClaimGraph vs ReferenceScheme changes).
* **`ScopeCard` / `U.ClaimScope`** — USM scope objects (A.2.6) describing where the episteme’s claims hold.

These attached structures are **not extra positions** of `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`; they hang off the `U.ClaimGraph`/`U.ReferenceScheme` pair and are governed by KD-CAL (C.2), A.10 and B.3. C.2.1 only requires that an episteme which participates in KD-CAL exposes them in a way that keeps **ClaimGraph / ReferenceScheme / Evidence / EditionSeries / `ClaimScope`** clearly distinguishable.

#### 4.2 Episteme as n‑ary relation and as holon

To prevent confusion between **objects‑of‑talk**, their **descriptions**, and the **places they occupy in an episteme**, C.2.1 explicitly treats epistemes both as:

1. **n‑ary relations with a signature** (slots & values), and
2. **holons with components** (fields & parts).

##### 4.2.1 `U.EpistemeKind` — episteme as a typed n‑ary relation

**Tech:** `U.EpistemeKind` (kernel type).

**Intent.** Provide a **signature‑level** description of an episteme as an n‑ary relation whose arguments are governed by `SlotKind`/`ValueKind`/`RefKind` triples per A.6.5.

**Normative definition.**

1. Every episteme that participates in KD‑CAL **belongs to some `U.EpistemeKind`**.
   The kind determines:

   * which **SlotKinds** appear (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, …),
   * the **ValueKind** for each slot (always a subtype of `U.Type`),
   * the **RefKind** used to store it in episteme (when applicable).
1. `U.EpistemeKind` is a **special case** of `U.Signature` (A.6.0), with its slots governed by `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` (A.6.5). C.2.1 **MUST NOT** define an alternative slot discipline.
2. For the minimal core, every `U.EpistemeKind` **MUST** include:
   * exactly one `ClaimGraphSlot`,
   * at least one `DescribedEntitySlot`,
   * and at least one `ReferenceSchemeSlot`.
     Inclusion of `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot` **MAY** be species‑level constraints (mandatory for D/S‑epistemes, optional for others).

**Didactic cue.**
“An `EpistemeKind` is the *type* of episteme: which positions it has and what can go into them.”

##### 4.2.2 `U.EpistemeTuple` — episteme as filled n‑ary relation

**Tech:** `U.EpistemeTuple` (kernel species).

**Intent.** Model **filled instances** of an episteme’s signature, separating the n‑ary relation from any particular holonic packaging or publication.

**Normative definition.**

1. `U.EpistemeTuple` is a species whose instances are **pure value tuples**:
   * for each SlotKind in the associated `U.EpistemeKind`, a value of the slot’s **ValueKind** (or a reference value of **RefKind**, if the kind is configured as such).
2. `U.EpistemeTuple` is **notation‑agnostic** and **carrier‑agnostic**: it does not know about files, formats, or surfaces.
   It exists to give A.6.2–A.6.4 a minimal notion of “episteme as a point in Ep”.
3. In episteme, `U.EpistemeTuple` rarely appears directly; it is typically **induced** by `U.EpistemeCard` and `U.EpistemeView` (which add component structure and meta‑information).

**Didactic cue.**
“An `EpistemeTuple` is the abstract record of *what fills which slots* — nothing more.”

##### 4.2.3 `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemePublication`, `U.EpistemeView` — holonic realisations

**Tech:** `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemePublication`, `U.EpistemeView` (species of `U.Episteme`).

**Intent.** Provide **holon‑level structures** that engineers can work with (components, mereology, provenance), while keeping them aligned with `U.EpistemeKind` and `U.EpistemeTuple`.

**Normative definition.**

1. **`U.EpistemeCard`.**
   A species of `U.Episteme` whose components correspond one‑to‑one to slots of some `U.EpistemeKind`:
   * `content : U.ClaimGraph` (for `ClaimGraphSlot`),
   * `describedEntityRef : U.EntityRef` (for `DescribedEntitySlot`),
   * `groundingHolonRef? : U.HolonRef` (for `GroundingHolonSlot`),
   * `viewpointRef? : U.ViewpointRef` (for `ViewpointSlot`),
   * `referenceScheme? : U.ReferenceScheme` (for `ReferenceSchemeSlot`),
   * optionally `representationSchemeRef? : U.RepresentationSchemeRef` (C.2.1+),
   * `meta : Edition/Provenance/Status…`.
     Minimal episteme identity is the pair `⟨content, describedEntityRef⟩` within a `U.BoundedContext`; all other fields are optional at the genus level but may be mandatory in species. Changes that alter `content` or the effective `referenceScheme` (or that intentionally re‑identify `describedEntityRef`) **SHALL** be realised as new phases in an `U.EditionSeries` (PhaseOf chain) under A.14/A.7. Changes confined to `U.PresentationCarrier` / surfaces or other publication artefacts **do not** create a new episteme; they are captured as `U.Work` / publication events over the same `U.Episteme`.
2. **`U.EpistemePublication`.**
   A species representing **epistemes that have been published** onto surfaces (MVPK). It:
   * has at least the components of `U.EpistemeCard`,
   * plus references to `U.Surface` / `U.Face` artefacts (E.17, L‑SURF),
   * but **does not** re‑interpret these surfaces as parts of the episteme; carriers remain external.
3. **`U.EpistemeView`.**
   As defined in §4.1.5, a species of `U.Episteme` representing a **view** under a specific `U.Viewpoint`.
   Its components are a specialisation of `U.EpistemeCard`:
   * ClaimGraph often restricted/projection of a base description/specification,
   * Viewpoint fixed,
   * ReferenceScheme tailored to that viewpoint.

**Alignment requirement.**
For any of these species, the pattern **MUST** state explicitly:
* which `U.EpistemeKind` it realises, and
* how each component maps to a SlotKind/RefKind under `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`.

This ensures that A.6.2–A.6.4 can treat any `U.Episteme*` uniformly as both:
* an object in the category **Ep**, and
* a structured holon with components.

##### 4.2.4 SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind discipline for DescribedEntity & GroundingHolon

C.2.1 adopts **A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`** wholesale. For the two key positions:
1. **DescribedEntitySlot.**
   * `SlotKind = DescribedEntitySlot`;
   * `ValueKind = U.Entity` (species may constrain to `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity`);
   * `RefKind = U.EntityRef` (or a species thereof);
   * normative field name in episteme cards: `describedEntityRef : U.EntityRef`.
     No kernel type named `U.DescribedEntity` is introduced; the phrase “described entity” always means “an instance of `U.Entity` in the role filling `DescribedEntitySlot`”.
1. **GroundingHolonSlot.**
   * `SlotKind = GroundingHolonSlot`;
   * `ValueKind = U.Holon`;
   * `RefKind = U.HolonRef`;
   * normative field name: `groundingHolonRef? : U.HolonRef`.
     There is no kernel type `U.GroundingHolon`; “grounding holon” is a **slot occupant name**.
Any episteme that previously mixed slot/value/ref concepts (e.g., using `DescribedEntityRef` as if it were a type) **MUST** be migrated to this discipline over time; C.2.1 provides the normative anchor, and F.18 / discipline packs provide the migration guide.

#### 4.3 Minimal epistemic morphisms (informal schema)

> **Note.** The full mathematical treatment (categories Ep and Ref, describedEntity functor `α : Ep → Ref`, and effect‑free morphisms) lives in A.6.2–A.6.4. Here we fix only the **object‑level relations** that C.2.1 expects to exist between its positions.

At the level of `U.EpistemeCard` components and SlotKinds, we assume the following **primitive relations** (not all are functions):

1. **`describedEntitySet : U.Episteme → P(U.Entity)`**
   *derivable from `DescribedEntitySlot` and `ReferenceScheme`*
   * For an episteme `E`, `describedEntitySet(E)` is (at least) the singleton containing the entity referenced by `describedEntityRef(E)`; in more complex cases, it may be a finite set or bundle of entities, determined by `ReferenceScheme`.
   * The **functorial DescribedEntity mapping** `δ_E : Ep → Ref` used in A.6.2–A.6.4 is the categorical lift of this relation: it forgets episteme internals and keeps only the object in the ReferencePlane determined by the pair `<DescribedEntitySlot, GroundingHolonSlot>`.

2. **`grounds : (U.Entity, U.Holon) ⇝ GroundingRelation`**
   *relates described entities to grounding holons*
   * Captures how values of `DescribedEntitySlot` are **situated** in holons that make evaluation possible (labs, infrastructures, organisations).
   * Need not be total or functional; an entity may admit multiple grounding holons, or none.

3. **`designates : (U.ReferenceScheme, U.ClaimGraph, U.Entity, U.Holon) ⇝ DesignationProfile`**
   *how claims are read as statements about entities in contexts*
   * Specifies, for each claim in `content` and each `<describedEntityRef, groundingHolonRef>`, what property/relation it purports to state, and under what conditions.

4. **`satisfies / evaluatesTo : (U.ClaimGraph, U.ReferenceScheme, U.Holon) → TruthProfile/SuccessProfile`**
   *evaluation of claims under a reference scheme and grounding*
   * Forms the bridge to KD‑CAL’s `F, G, R` evaluation; details are given in C.2 and B.3.

5. **View-related morphisms** (to be connected with A.6.3):
   * `viewProject : (U.Episteme, U.Viewpoint) → U.View`
     — effect-free, **DescribedEntity-preserving** projection that slices `ClaimGraph` and specialises `ReferenceScheme` under a given viewpoint.
   * `viewEmbed : U.View → U.Episteme`
     — embedding of a view back into the wider episteme, typically as a reference with correspondence proofs.

5. **Reflexive describedEntity guard.**
   When `DescribedEntitySlot` or `ReferenceScheme` picks out an episteme or claim that includes the referring claim itself (**ReferencePlane = episteme**), publishers **SHALL** ensure that the induced justification/evaluation structure is **acyclic per evaluation chain**: reflexive describedEntities may exist as literature handles, but they MUST NOT form a minimal support cycle for acceptance or KD‑CAL assurance. Self‑reference is allowed as a citation pattern, not as a way to close justification loops.

These are **not yet laws**; they are the **hooks** that A.6.2–A.6.4 will formalise into:
* `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (Ep→Ep morphisms over this structure),
* `U.EpistemicViewing` (describedEntity‑preserving Ep→Ep),
* `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (describedEntity‑retargeting Ep→Ep).

### 5 · Legacy semantic triangle as didactic view  *(informative)*

**Position.** The classical semiotic or semantic triangle (“Symbol–Concept–Object”, Ogden–Richards/Frege–Carnap style) is **not** the normative ontology for epistemes in FPF. For `U.Episteme`, it is treated as a **didactic projection** of the richer hypergraph `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`:
* **“Symbol” corner** ≈ {`U.RepresentationToken`, `U.RepresentationScheme`, `U.PresentationCarrier`} when C.2.1+ is in use; in the minimal core this is collapsed into whichever external artefact happens to carry `U.ClaimGraph`.
* **“Concept” corner** ≈ `U.ClaimGraph` + `U.ReferenceScheme` under a chosen `U.Viewpoint`. This is the intensional content plus its interpretation recipe.
* **“Object” corner** ≈ the occupant of `DescribedEntitySlot` (ValueKind `U.Entity`) plus the occupant of `GroundingHolonSlot` (ValueKind `U.Holon`) and the grounding relation between them.

Under this reading the triangle is a **three‑node quotient** of the `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`:
```
(Symbol)      = RepresentationToken + Scheme + Carrier
(Concept)     = ClaimGraph + ReferenceScheme (+ Viewpoint)
(Object)      = DescribedEntity + GroundingHolon
```

All **viewpoints, operations, carriers and reference planes** are suppressed in the classical diagram. The cost of this suppression is precisely the confusion that motivates C.2.1:
* describing becomes an single unlabeled arrow,
* inference regimes disappear,
* measurement and grounding are invisible.

**Didactic use.** C.2.1 allows the triangle **only** in the following cases:
1. As an **introductory picture** in guidance material (“this is the coarse triangle; the actual pattern is the episteme slot graph”).
2. As a **quotient diagram**: an explicit note that “this figure ignores viewpoint, grounding, carrier, and operationality; see C.2.1 for the full structure”.
3. As a **legacy alignment aid** when mapping to standards or literature that speak only in triangle terms.

**Guard.** Any pattern or documentation page that uses a “semantic triangle” diagram **MUST** either:
* explicitly state “this is a didactic projection of C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`”, or
* treat it as a legacy reference when aligning with external standards.

The triangle **MUST NOT** be used as a kernel‑level ontology or as a basis for morphism laws. All normative reasoning about epistemes proceeds via the slots and components of `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.

### 6 · Interaction with I/D/S and DescriptionContext  *(normative)*

C.2.1 is the **episteme‑layer carrier** that I/D/S discipline (A.7, E.10.D2) relies on. The link is made via `DescriptionContext`.

#### 6.1 · DescriptionContext over C.2.1 components

For any episteme that is a **Description** or a **Specification** in the sense of E.10.D2, the field `subjectRef : U.SubjectRef` is interpreted as a **DescriptionContext triple**:
```
DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩
```

where:
* `DescribedEntityRef : U.EntityRef` — occupies `DescribedEntitySlot` (ValueKind `U.Entity`, species often constrained via EoIClass ⊑ `U.Entity`).
* `BoundedContextRef : U.BoundedContextRef` — points to the context that fixes vocabulary, units, and legal inferences for this description (E.10.D1).
* `ViewpointRef : U.ViewpointRef` — occupies `ViewpointSlot` (ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`) and determines which concerns, role‑enactor families, and conformance rules apply.

**Normative requirement (IDS‑13).**
For every `…Description` / `…Spec` episteme:
1. `subjectRef` **SHALL** be decodable to a well‑formed DescriptionContext triple.
2. `DescribedEntityRef` from that triple **SHALL** be identical to the field `describedEntityRef` that fills `DescribedEntitySlot` in the corresponding `U.EpistemeCard`/`U.EpistemeView`.
3. `ViewpointRef` in DescriptionContext **SHALL** agree with `viewpointRef` in the episteme card or be uniquely derivable from a `U.ViewpointBundle` in E.17.1 (with the derivation rule documented).

Intensions (I‑layer) such as `U.System`, `U.Method`, `U.Role` **do not** inhabit C.2.1 directly; they are the *targets* of I→D operations (`Describe_ID`) and appear as values of `DescribedEntitySlot` in resulting descriptions/specs.

#### 6.2 · I→D and D→S morphisms over C.2.1

* **Describing (`Describe_ID : I → D`).**
  Produces an episteme whose:
  * `content : U.ClaimGraph` encodes the descriptive claims about the intension,
  * `describedEntityRef` points to the intension’s entity,
  * `groundingHolonRef` (if present) fixes where the description is evaluated or tested,
  * `viewpointRef` selects the describing viewpoint.

  `Describe_ID` is **conformant** to A.6.2 but not an Ep→Ep morphism (domain is Intension, codomain is Episteme). C.2.1 provides the **codomain schema** and ensures that the resulting Description has a valid DescriptionContext.

* **Specifying/Formalising (`Specify_DS/Formalize_DS : D → S`).**
  Takes a Description episteme and returns a Specification episteme with:
  * the same `describedEntityRef`,
  * the same `BoundedContextRef` and `ViewpointRef` (hence same DescriptionContext),
  * a `content : U.ClaimGraph` that raises formality F (F≥4) and adds test harness hooks, but is conservative with respect to the underlying intension.

  As an Ep→Ep morphism, `Specify_DS` is a **species of A.6.2** and must obey the invariants over the C.2.1 slots (DescribedEntityChangeMode = preserve; no change to DescribedEntity; ClaimGraph refinement only).

C.2.1 does **not** define I/D/S; it only insists that any `…Description`/`…Spec` species that claims to respect I/D/S discipline must:
* implement `U.EpistemeCard` or `U.EpistemeView` **with** `content`, `describedEntityRef`, `groundingHolonRef?`, `viewpointRef?`, and `referenceScheme?` fields, and
* wire these fields into `subjectRef` as DescriptionContext.

### 7 · Alignment with A.6.2–A.6.4 (episteme morphisms)  *(normative)*
`U.EpistemeSlotGraph` is the **object‑level substrate** for the episteme morphism patterns:
* A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`
* A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`
* A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting`

#### 7.1 · Effect‑free episteme morphisms (A.6.2) over C.2.1
For any `f : X → Y` that is an instance of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`:
* **Typed objects.**
  X and Y are `U.Episteme` instances realised as `U.EpistemeCard` / `U.EpistemeView` with at least the minimal core components:

  ```
  content            : U.ClaimGraph
  describedEntityRef : U.EntityRef      // DescribedEntitySlot
  groundingHolonRef? : U.HolonRef       // GroundingHolonSlot
  viewpointRef?      : U.ViewpointRef   // ViewpointSlot
  referenceScheme?   : U.ReferenceScheme// ReferenceSchemeSlot (ByValue)
  ```

  Any additional C.2.1+ components (RepresentationScheme, Tokens, Carriers, Operations) are visible to A.6.2 only through their declared SlotKinds (A.6.5).
* **DescribedEntityChangeMode characteristic.**
  `f` **MUST** declare a **`describedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}`**:
  * `preserve` — `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)` and any change to `groundingHolonRef`/`viewpointRef` must be justified by Bridges/CorrespondenceModel, without changing the DescribedEntitySlot value;
  * `retarget` — permitted only for A.6.4 species; see below; in this case the characteristic records an intentional change in the pair `<describedEntityRef, groundingHolonRef>` under a declared `KindBridge` in the appropriate ReferencePlane.

  This **DescribedEntityChangeMode** is a CHR-style *characteristic* (A.17) on episteme morphisms, which points directly to `DescribedEntitySlot`. Avoid introducing a separate “describedEntity” term alongside `DescribedEntity`. 
  
* **Component discipline.**
  P0–P5 from A.6.2 are read **directly** in terms of C.2.1 components:
  * purity ⇒ only C.2.1 components of Y may change; no Work/Mechanism side‑effects;
  * conservativity ⇒ claims in `content_Y` read via `referenceScheme_Y` about the new `<DescribedEntity, GroundingHolon>` do not go beyond what already follows from `content_X` via `referenceScheme_X` under the declared DescribedEntityChangeMode and Bridges;
  * functoriality ⇒ composition of such transformations respects the slot structure and ReferenceSchemes.

Any Ep→Ep pattern that operates on `U.Episteme` **MUST** state which C.2.1 slots it reads and which it may write, in terms of SlotKinds/ValueKinds/RefKinds (A.6.5), and then declare itself a species of A.6.2/3/4 as appropriate.

#### 7.2 · EpistemicViewing (A.6.3) as describedEntity‑preserving projections

`U.EpistemicViewing` is the **DescribedEntity-preserving** species of A.6.2. Over C.2.1 this means:
* `describedEntityRef(Y) = describedEntityRef(X)` — the same value in `DescribedEntitySlot`.
* `groundingHolonRef` is preserved, or changed only within a fixed grounding context (e.g. normalising identifiers for the same lab or runtime).
* `viewpointRef` is either:
  * preserved (internal normalisation under the same viewpoint), or
  * replaced by another `U.ViewpointRef` *within* a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family (E.17.0), with invariants enforced by a CorrespondenceModel.
* `content` and `referenceScheme` are transformed **conservatively**: no new intensional claims about the same DescribedEntity are introduced.

Typical examples:
* filtering or aggregating `U.ClaimGraph` to a view relevant for a stakeholder group;
* rendering a behavioural specification into a tabular or diagrammatic episteme under a publication viewpoint;
* normalising a logic‑heavy episteme into a more operational one, while keeping the same described system and context.

In terms of SoTA, EpistemicViewing behaves like a **lens** or **optic** over C.2.1: a focus (SlotKinds for content/representation) is manipulated while the DescribedEntity is fixed.

#### 7.3 · EpistemicRetargeting (A.6.4) as DescribedEntity-bundle retargeting on episteme morphisms

`U.EpistemicRetargeting` is the species of A.6.2 where **`describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`**.
It is always a **morphism between epistemes** (`f : X → Y` in `U.Episteme`), but the adjective “retargeting” refers **not** to the fact that an episteme is mapped to another episteme (this is true for all A.6.2 species), and **not** to a separate describedEntity, but specifically to the **change in the DescribedEntity-bundle** selected by C.2.1:
* `describedEntityRef(Y) ≠ describedEntityRef(X)` — the value stored for `DescribedEntitySlot` changes;
* a `KindBridge` must relate `Kind(describedEntityRef(X))` and `Kind(describedEntityRef(Y))`;
* `groundingHolonRef` may remain the same (e.g. same plant, different subsystem) or be transformed along a Bridge in the same ReferencePlane.

In practice, many retargetings operate on the **target bundle** `<DescribedEntitySlot, GroundingHolonSlot>` (for example, when an episteme about a physical module is re-interpreted as an episteme about a function-holon realised in a different environment). The characteristic `describedEntityChangeMode` still classifies such morphisms by whether this bundle is preserved or intentionally re-identified under a `KindBridge` and reference-plane policy; the episteme on the codomain side is just the usual A.6.2 target object.


Over C.2.1 this is used for:
* **functional vs structural reinterpretation** (e.g. an episteme about a physical module retargeted to an episteme about the function it realises; StructuralReinterpretation in E.TGA becomes a species of A.6.4);
* **signal vs spectrum** transitions (Fourier‑style moves where the object‑of‑talk changes from time‑domain signal to frequency‑domain representation but an invariant, such as energy, is preserved);
* **data vs model** transitions (e.g. retargeting an episteme about raw observations to an episteme about a learnt model, with an invariant such as likelihood or sufficient statistics).

C.2.1 ensures that these retargetings have a **clear source and target** at the DescribedEntitySlot and that any such move is expressed as a morphism over well‑typed slots, not as an unstructured rewrite of “subject” or “object” labels.

### 8 · Alignment with E.17.* (Multi‑View Describing & Publication)  *(normative)*

`U.EpistemeSlotGraph` underpins the E.17 cluster:
* E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`
* E.17.1 `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`
* E.17.2 `TEVB — Typical Engineering Viewpoints Bundle`
* E.17 `MVPK — Multi‑View Publication Kit`

#### 8.1 · Multi‑View Describing (E.17.0)

`U.MultiViewDescribing` organises **families of descriptions/specifications** over a shared entity‑of‑interest:
* The **EoIClass** parameter of E.17.0 is a species constraint on the ValueKind of `DescribedEntitySlot` (`EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity`).
* Each member of a multi‑view family is a `…Description`/`…Spec` episteme with:
  * `describedEntityRef` into that EoIClass,
  * `viewpointRef` drawn from a `U.ViewpointBundle`,
  * `subjectRef` decoding to DescriptionContext.

Within this pattern:
* `U.Viewpoint` is **exactly** the ValueKind of `ViewpointSlot` in C.2.1.
* `U.View` is `U.EpistemeView`, a species of `U.Episteme` whose `content` is already restricted to a particular `U.Viewpoint` and often also to a particular `U.RepresentationScheme`.

C.2.1 thus supplies the **per‑episteme** structure that E.17.0 rearranges into multi‑view families.

#### 8.2 · Viewpoint bundles (E.17.1/E.17.2)

`U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` and TEVB specialise the `U.Viewpoint` node:
* A ViewpointBundle is a **set of `U.Viewpoint` instances** tailored to a class of DescribedEntities (e.g., holons in engineering contexts).
* TEVB fixes `EoIClass = U.Holon` (typically `U.System` or `U.Episteme`) and provides canonical engineering viewpoints: functional, structural, role‑enactor, interface‑oriented, etc.

From the C.2.1 perspective:

* these bundles populate the ValueKind of `ViewpointSlot`;
* engineering episteme species that want to be “TEVB‑aligned” must restrict `viewpointRef` to TEVB’s `EngineeringVPId` set, while keeping the same DescribedEntitySlot discipline.

#### 8.3 · MVPK (E.17) as publication over C.2.1 views

MVPK treats `U.View` (i.e. `U.EpistemeView`) as its primary input:
* it uses `U.EpistemicViewing` species (A.6.3) to generate publication‑oriented views from engineering or logical views;
* it then packages these `U.View` epistemes into `U.Surface` artefacts via publication viewpoints and faces.

C.2.1’s distinction between:

* `U.Viewpoint` (intensional, epistemic perspective) and
* `U.PresentationCarrier` (surface in C.2.1+ and L‑SURF)

keeps **epistemic perspective and physical medium separate**:
* MVPK operates only on epistemes (Views) and then on carriers;
* the same View can be realised on multiple carriers without changing its describedEntity or ClaimGraph.

Any MVPK species that claims to be C.2.1‑conformant **MUST**:
* treat `U.View` as a `U.EpistemeView` with a valid C.2.1 core,
* document which C.2.1 slots it reads/writes (typically only representation/carrier‑related ones, leaving `DescribedEntitySlot` and `GroundingHolonSlot` untouched),
* refrain from introducing new claims about the described entity beyond what is in the source `U.View`’s ClaimGraph.

### 9 · Bias‑annotation  *(informative)*

**Episteme‑first and pragmatics‑first.**
The pattern assumes that *nothing is a meaningful episteme* unless it is **about something for someone under some perspective**. This follows the pragmatic turn in semantics: describedEntity and concerns are not afterthoughts but part of the core structure. The graph is therefore built around slots for DescribedEntity, GroundingHolon, Viewpoint and ClaimGraph, not around abstract “propositions in the void”.

**Operational/representational bias.**
C.2.1+ anticipates that certain RepresentationSchemes are **operational** in Novaes’ sense (supporting direct syntactic inference, like pen‑and‑paper arithmetic or proof states) while others are **purely notational**. The pattern remains neutral on which schemes are used but bakes in a place for operations and carriers so that:

* symbol‑manipulating tools (SAT/SMT, proof assistants, classical programming languages),
* distributed/latent representations (LLM embeddings, latent protocols like “DroidSpeak”, “Coconut”‑style communication),
* hybrid ReAct‑style agent loops

can all be treated as different species operating over the same `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`. There is a bias towards making these operational differences **explicit** instead of hiding them behind “the model”.

**Viewpoint and stakeholder bias.**
The pattern leans on the ISO‑style idea that viewpoints encode **stakeholder concerns and role‑families**, but it generalises this beyond architecture. `U.Viewpoint` is intentionally intensional and not bound to any single discipline; still, the examples are skewed toward engineering and epistemic use‑cases.

**Didactic bias.**
The pattern is written to be teachable: semantic triangles are kept as didactic projections; examples like stools on lab rigs, services and SLAs, and model‑evaluation epistemes are deliberately simple. This may under‑represent more exotic epistemes (e.g. artistic, legal, or socio‑technical ones), but the intention is that these use the same slots with different species‑level constraints.

### 10 · Conformance checklist  *(normative)*

**CC‑C.2.1‑1 · Minimal core components for episteme species.**
Any species of `U.Episteme` that participates in I/D/S discipline or in E.17 multi‑view/publishing **MUST** be representable as `U.EpistemeCard`/`U.EpistemeView` with at least:

```
content            : U.ClaimGraph
describedEntityRef : U.EntityRef
groundingHolonRef? : U.HolonRef
viewpointRef?      : U.ViewpointRef
referenceScheme?   : U.ReferenceScheme      // ByValue
meta               : …                      // edition, provenance, status (A.7/F.15)
```

and corresponding SlotSpecs consistent with A.6.5 (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`).

**CC‑C.2.1‑2 · No kernel type for “DescribedEntity” or “GroundingHolon”.**
Patterns **MUST NOT** introduce kernel types `U.DescribedEntity` or `U.GroundingHolon`:
* DescribedEntitySlot has ValueKind `U.Entity` ( species‑constrained via EoIClass if needed),
* GroundingHolonSlot has ValueKind `U.Holon`.

Plain terms “described entity” and “grounding holon” are allowed only as **role descriptions** of slot occupants.

**CC‑C.2.1‑3 · SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline.**
All episteme‑related slots, including `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (and any extensions in C.2.1+), **MUST**:
* follow the naming discipline of A.6.5 (`*Slot` for SlotKinds, `*Ref` only for RefKinds/fields),
* declare a ValueKind and refMode (`ByValue` or a RefKind),
* be used consistently across patterns that refer to the same conceptual position.

**CC‑C.2.1‑4 · DescriptionContext wiring.**
Any episteme species whose name or pattern claims to be a `…Description` or `…Spec` in the sense of E.10.D2 **MUST**:
* expose `subjectRef : U.SubjectRef`,
* provide a decoding to `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`,
* ensure that `DescribedEntityRef` matches `describedEntityRef` (DescribedEntitySlot), and
* ensure that `ViewpointRef` matches `viewpointRef` or is derivable from a `U.ViewpointBundle` under documented rules.

**CC‑C.2.1‑5 · Morphism declarations over slots.**
Any pattern in A.6.2–A.6.4, E.17, E.TGA, or discipline packs that defines morphisms between epistemes **SHALL**:
* state whether it is a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`, `U.EpistemicViewing`, or `U.EpistemicRetargeting`,
* declare its `describedEntityChangeMode` (preserve/retarget),
* name which SlotKinds it reads and writes,
* state its behaviour on `describedEntityRef`, `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, and `referenceScheme`.

**CC‑C.2.1‑6 · Semantic‑triangle usage guard.**
If a semantic triangle or parallelogram diagram appears in a pattern or tutorial, there must be an explicit note that:
* it is a didactic projection of `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`, and
* normative laws are stated in terms of C.2.1 nodes and morphisms, not in terms of triangle corners.

**CC‑C.2.1‑7 · KD‑CAL / ReferencePlane alignment.**
Any pattern that evaluates or compares epistemes (KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL, CHR, CG‑Spec, etc.) **MUST** point out:
* how `U.ClaimGraph` is interpreted in a ReferencePlane,
* how `GroundingHolonSlot` figures into measurement or validation,

**CC‑C.2.1‑8 · Context locality and Bridges.**
Any `U.Episteme` species that is consumed by KD‑CAL / LOG‑CAL / CHR‑based patterns **SHALL** declare a `U.BoundedContextRef`; all F–G–R computations and C.2.1 slot interpretations are **context‑local**.  Cross‑context use **MUST** proceed via an explicit Bridge with CL / Φ‑policy (F.9/B.3), with penalties routed to R‑lanes only; F and the slot structure from C.2.1 remain unchanged.

**CC‑C.2.1‑9 · Carriers and Work outside episteme content.**
C.2.1 **inherits** A.7/A.12’s separation obligations: `U.PresentationCarrier` / `U.Surface` artefacts and `U.Work` instances **MUST NOT** be treated as parts of `U.Episteme` or as values of any SlotKind in `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`. Episteme content stays in `U.ClaimGraph` and `U.ReferenceScheme`; evidence enters only via `U.EvidenceRole` bindings that point to external `U.Work` / carriers (A.10/B.3). Changing carriers or re‑publishing work alone does **not** change the episteme determined by ⟨content, describedEntityRef, referenceScheme⟩ in its `U.BoundedContext`.

**CC‑C.2.1‑10 · Reflexive describedEntity guard.**
When an episteme uses C.2.1 to speak **about** another episteme (ReferencePlane = episteme), or about itself (self‑describing or meta‑specification cases), patterns **SHALL** ensure that the resulting JustificationGraph / evaluation chains are **acyclic** along support paths. Reflexive `describe` / citation edges may exist as literature anchors, but they MUST NOT form minimal support cycles for acceptance or KD‑CAL assurance decisions; the trust calculus MUST always bottom out in external evidence (`U.Work` with `U.EvidenceRole`) rather than in purely self‑referential claims.

### 11 · Consequences  *(informative)*

**Benefits**
* **Single, extensible episteme core.**
  C.2.1 gives a small, stable set of positions (DescribedEntity, GroundingHolon, ClaimGraph, Viewpoint, View, ReferenceScheme) and components (`U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, `U.EpistemePublication`) on which all higher‑level patterns depend. This avoids the proliferation of “epistemic objects” and “facets” with overlapping semantics.
**Transparent DescribedEntity & grounding discipline.**
  The pair (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`) is no longer hidden inside ad-hoc “SubjectRef” fields or semantic triangles: both are explicit, typed slots. This makes retargeting, viewing and correspondence laws (A.6.2–A.6.4, E.17.0) easier to state and check.
* **Better fit for contemporary representation practice.**
  By distinguishing ClaimGraph, RepresentationScheme, Tokens, Carriers and Operations (in C.2.1+), the pattern matches contemporary SoTA views of notation and formalism:
  * formal languages as cognitive artefacts and de‑semanticisation tools (Novaes),
  * operational iconicity and medium‑sensitive reasoning (Krämer, Malafouris),
  * hybrid symbolic–neural workflows (e.g. ReAct, tool‑augmented LLMs, latent protocols).
  FPF can model both symbol‑heavy and latent‑heavy workflows without privileging either.
* **Uniform substrate for multi‑view description and publication.**
  MultiViewDescribing, viewpoint bundles (TEVB), and MVPK all land on the same episteme core. This avoids the current “views vs viewpoints vs faces” confusion and leaves “architecture” as a domain‑specific specialisation rather than a competing meta‑ontology.
* **Tooling alignment.**
  Slot discipline plus explicit episteme components map cleanly to implementation types (records, row‑typed schemas, effectful handlers). Tools can generate code, schemas or telemetry from episteme species without guessing what “subject”, “context” or “object” mean.

**Trade‑offs / costs**
* **More explicit structure.**
  Authors must declare slots, ValueKinds and references explicitly, and keep DescriptionContext consistent. This is more upfront work than writing ad‑hoc “Subject/Object” fields, but it pays off in substitution safety and cross‑pattern reuse.
* **Migration effort.**
  Legacy uses of “EpistemicObject”, “Facet”, “Subject”/“Object”, and raw `…Ref` fields will need refactoring into C.2.1 slots + A.6.5 SlotSpecs. Migration notes and aliasing can ease the transition, but mechanical cleanup will still be required.
* **Exposure of representation biases.**
  Being explicit about RepresentationSchemes and Operations may surface disagreements about which representations are “primary” in a team or discipline. C.2.1 does not resolve these disagreements; it only makes them visible and therefore debatable.

#### 12 · Relations  *(overview)*

**Builds on**
* A.1 `U.Holon` — for treating episteme as a holon with components.
* A.6.0 `U.Signature` — for interpreting episteme kinds as n‑ary relations over slots.
* A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` — for SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline over episteme slots.
* A.7, E.10.D2 — for I/D/S discipline and the Interpretation of `subjectRef` as DescriptionContext.
* C.2 (KD‑CAL, LOG‑CAL) — for ClaimGraph semantics, ReferencePlanes, and Bridges.
* E.8, E.10 — for pattern authoring discipline and lexical guards.

* **Constrains**
* A.6.2–A.6.4 — by fixing the minimal episteme component set those morphisms operate on and by requiring an explicit **DescribedEntityChangeMode characteristic** (`describedEntityChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}`) over `DescribedEntitySlot`/`GroundingHolonSlot`.
* E.17.0–E.17.2 — by specifying how `DescribedEntity`, `Viewpoint`, `View` and ReferenceSchemes are represented at episteme level.
* E.17 (MVPK) — by separating `U.View` (episteme) from `U.PresentationCarrier` (surface), and by requiring that publication morphisms be `U.EpistemicViewing` species over C.2.1‑conformant views.
* F.18 (LEX‑BUNDLE) — by providing the episteme‑specific name cards and guards for DescribedEntity/GroundingHolon/Viewpoint/View/ReferenceScheme and their SlotKinds.

**Used by**
* A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` — as the default episteme object structure for episteme‑to‑episteme transforms.
* A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing` — as the substrate for describedEntity‑preserving projections (views).
* A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting` — as the substrate for DescribedEntity-bundle retargeting transforms between epistemes (Ep→Ep with `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`).
* E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`, E.17.1, E.17.2 — to organise families of D/S‑epistemes under Viewpoints and EoI classes.
* E.17 (MVPK) — to publish episteme views as surfaces.
* E.TGA — to interpret StructuralReinterpretation and other engineering projections as episteme morphisms over a well‑typed `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.

Together, these relations make `U.EpistemeSlotGraph` the **single normative core** for thinking about epistemes, their DescribedEntity mapping, their representations, and their transformations across FPF.

# C.2.3 · **Unified Formality Characteristic F**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **Formality (F)** as a single, ordinal **Characteristic** (`U.Formality`) with **polarity “up”**, anchored by a **default ladder F0…F9** from **free prose** to **proof‑grade foundations**. This unifies how rigor is declared and compared across all epistemes and contexts, and supplies the **F‑coordinate** in the F–G–R assurance space.

---

### 0 · Status & Scope

**Status.** Normative pattern in **KD‑CAL / Part C.2**. It **replaces** the legacy “modes/tiers” language and any parallel “formality ladders.” The letter **F** hereafter denotes the **Formality** characteristic in the **F–G–R** triple.

**Scope.** Conceptual only. The pattern **does not** prescribe workflows, toolchains, or team procedures. It specifies *what Formality is and how to measure/declare it*, so that any team, discipline, or architheory can think and communicate rigor with the same yardstick.

**Non‑goals.**
– Not a publication process, not a governance gate.
– Not a reliability metric (R) and not a scope/abstraction metric (G).
– Not tied to any notation, repository layout, or CI/CD practice.

## C.20 · **Discipline‑CAL — Composition of `U.Discipline`**  \[A]  *(Architheory: CAL)*

**Builds on.** **C.2 KD‑CAL** (F–G–R & CL routing), **A.19/G.0 CG‑Spec** (comparability), **F.9 Bridges** (cross‑Context alignment), **E.10 LEX** (registers & twin labels). **Coordinates with.** **C.21** (Discipline‑CHR, field health), **C.23** (Method‑SoS‑LOG), **F.17–F.18** (UTS). 

### 1 · Problem Frame
Disciplines persist as *knowledge canons* (epistemes), *codified practices & standards*, and *institutional carriers* (journals, bodies, curricula). FPF needs a typed, provenance‑preserving way to **compose** these into a reusable **holon of talk** that travels across contexts *lawfully*. Composition must honour KD‑CAL lanes and the CG‑Spec Standard so that any numeric comparison or aggregation remains auditable and legal.

### 2 · Problem
Without a **composition calculus** for disciplines:
* fields degenerate into labels; editions and rival **Traditions/Lineages** blur;  
* cross‑Context reuse silently drops meaning (no Bridge/CL), or performs illegal aggregations (means on ordinals; unit mixing);  
* selectors (Part G) cannot lawfully gate methods because maturity/evidence are not tied to a field’s canon and carriers.

### 3 · Forces
| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Pluralism vs Cohesion** | Rival traditions must co‑exist ↔ a discipline holon must present a coherent public surface. |
| **Locality vs Federation** | Meaning is context‑local (rooms) ↔ reuse needs Bridges with CL and recorded loss notes. |
| **Rigor vs Agility** | CG‑Spec legality, KD‑CAL lanes ↔ practical authoring and edition flow (UTS/DRR). |
| **Didactic surface vs Assurance depth** | Human‑readable Discipline Card ↔ auditable F–G–R & provenance. |

### 4 · Solution — the **Discipline holon** and Γ_disc

#### 4.1 U.Types (minting & registers)
* **`U.Discipline`** — a **Holon** that composes an **EpistemeCanon**, **Standards/Practices**, and **Organisational Carriers** into a durable **unit of talk** (R‑core name; twin labels).  
* **`U.AppliedDiscipline`**, **`U.Transdiscipline`** — subtypes of `U.Discipline`.  (**Kernel U‑types; LEX‑governed**).
* **`U.Tradition`**, **`U.Lineage`** — auxiliary holons that organise variants/editions within a `U.Discipline`.  

**Placement/LEX.** `U.Discipline` and its subtypes are **Kernel U‑types** introduced under the **Open‑Ended Kernel** & **Ontological Parsimony** guards (**A.5**, **A.11**) and registered per **E.10/F.17**. This CAL **uses** them, it does not redefine them. If not yet present in A‑cluster, mark as **“provisionally minted”** and open a DRR to finalize placement (E.10 V‑ladder). 

All are **UTS‑published** with **twin labels**; minting follows **E.10** registers/prefix policy and **A.11** parsimony.

#### 4.2 What a `U.Discipline` is / is not
* A `U.Discipline` is **not** a `U.BoundedContext` and **not** a **Domain**. **Domain** remains a *catalog label* (stitched to D.CTX + UTS): **Discipline ≠ Domain** is enforceable via **E.10 LexicalCheck**; any cross‑Domain/Context reuse **MUST** cite a **Bridge (F.9) + CL + loss notes**; penalties to **R** only; **F/G invariant** (USM/KD‑CAL). 
* **Comparability** of a discipline flows **only through** the discipline’s **CG‑Spec** entries (no ad‑hoc formulas).  
* Cross‑Context/Tradition reuse **MUST** use **Bridge(s)** with **CL** and loss notes; **CL penalties route to R** (KD‑CAL/B.3); **F/G remain invariant**.  
* Public naming surfaces obey **LEX** (I/D/S; twin labels; banned heads); “discipline column” is **didactic only** and **carries no semantics** (enforced by LexicalCheck).

#### 4.3 Constructor **Γ_disc** (CAL export)
*Signature.*  
`Γ_disc : ⟨EpistemeCanon, StandardsSet, OrgCarriers, {Bridges}, Policy⟩ → U.Discipline`  
*Intent.* Fold the three constituents into a `U.Discipline`, **preserving provenance**, publishing UTS cards, and enabling lawful comparability via referenced **CG‑Spec** rows.  
*Obligations.*  
1) **Provenance & lanes.** Each imported episteme/standard declares **A.10 anchors** and lane tags **{TA, VA, LA}**; freshness windows are recorded.  
2) **Assurance fold.** Use KD‑CAL weakest‑link on R with **Φ(CL)** (and, where applicable, **Φ_plane** for ReferencePlane crossings) **table‑backed and monotone**; publish policy ids. For any justification **path P**, compute **`R_eff(P) = max(0, min_i R_i − Φ(CL_min(P)))`**; for parallel independent lines to the *same* claim take **`R(Γ) = max_P R_eff(P)`**; **`F(Γ)=min`** along used paths. No thresholds inside CHR/CAL (Acceptance‑only). Unknowns propagate as {pass|degrade|abstain} to Acceptance. 
3) **CG‑Spec guard.** Any numeric comparison/aggregation in Discipline reports **MUST** cite the discipline’s **CG‑Spec** with lawful **Gauge/Γ‑fold** and **MinimalEvidence**; units/scale/polarity legality via **MM‑CHR/CSLC** precedes aggregation.  
4) **Scale/Unit/Polarity legality.** Before any comparison/aggregation, **prove legality via MM‑CHR/CSLC** and cite **CG‑Spec characteristic ids** used in the fold (A.17–A.19).
5) **ReferencePlane guard.** When crossings touch `world|concept|episteme`, apply **CL_meta** and route penalties to **R** only; record **plane** on the UTS row.
6) **Edition discipline.** Changes to canons/standards that alter computed ⟨F,G,R⟩ **create a new edition**; DRR captures the rationale; UTS lifecycle records transitions.  
7) **No stealth globalisation.** Cross‑Context mappings are **by Bridge only**; “by‑name reuse” is forbidden** even with similar labels.

#### 4.4 Discipline ESG (state graph, informative surface)

Export a **Discipline.ESG** with named states and guarded transitions (e.g., *Emerging → Consolidating → Codified → Fragmenting*), where **guards reference C.21 metrics** (CHR‑typed; **Scale/Unit/Polarity + freshness windows**) and cite **CG‑Spec ids**; **all thresholds live only in AcceptanceClauses** (G.4). ESG is **descriptive**; all gating remains in CHR/CAL/LOG packs.

### 5 · Archetypal Grounding *(Tell–Show–Show)*

| Slot | **System** (safety code in a factory) | **Episteme** (discipline canon across editions) |
|---|---|---|
| **Object** | Production line with hazardous operations | “Safety engineering” as *describedEntity target* (accident models, tolerable risk) |
| **Concept** | Acceptance clauses & evaluation templates bound to rigs/windows | Canon texts: causality models, design rules, proofs/benchmarks (e.g., **formal knowledge bases**, **proof artefacts**, **concept schemas**) |
| **Symbol** | Local SOP/notation sets for checklists | Notation packages (CLIF, RDF/TriG, proof scripts) |
| **Γ_disc assembly** | Fold {line‑specific standard, plant procedures, certifying unit} into **`Discipline: Safety‑Plant‑A`** | Fold {canon papers, formal models, journals/committee} into **`Discipline: Safety‑Engineering`** with **Traditions** (e.g., system safety vs resilience engineering) |
| **Evidence lanes** | LA test campaigns (freshness windows), VA design proofs, TA tool quals | VA proofs over kinds, LA replications/meta‑analyses; TA for checkers |

### 6 · Bias‑Annotation
**Lenses:** Governance (naming/UTS), Architecture (CAL+CHR split), Onto/Epist (discipline ≠ domain; triangle fidelity), Pragmatic (authoring/editions), Didactic (twin labels; System/Episteme scenes). **Scope:** context‑local; no “global discipline”.

### 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)
| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **CC‑C20‑1 (CG‑Spec linkage).** | A `U.Discipline` **SHALL** declare the **CG‑Spec** ids and **CHR characteristic ids** behind any comparison/aggregation; thresholds live only in **Acceptance** clauses referenced by those CG‑Specs. | Auditable comparability; no illegal ops. |
| **CC‑C20‑2 (Bridge‑only reuse).** | Any cross‑Context/Tradition use **SHALL** cite **Bridge id + CL + loss notes**; penalties **route to R only**; **F/G invariant**. | Prevent silent globalisation; align with KD‑CAL. |
| **CC‑C20‑3 (ReferencePlane).** For any crossing touching `world|concept|episteme`, **publish plane** and apply **Φ(CL)** (and **Φ_plane**, where applicable) — both **MUST** be **monotone, bounded, table‑backed**; **unknowns** propagate as **{pass|degrade|abstain}** into **Acceptance** with **SCR note**; **no silent `unknown→0`**. |
| **CC‑C20‑4 (Γ_disc integrity).** | `Γ_disc` **MUST** record lane tags and freshness windows for all imported evidence; **Φ(CL)** **MUST** be monotone and table‑backed per policy. | Deterministic assurance; hygiene of penalties. |
| **CC‑C20‑5 (Edition & DRR).** | Discipline editions **SHALL** be recorded via **UTS lifecycle** with DRR links; no silent rewrites or renames. | Traceable evolution. |
| **CC‑C20‑6 (LEX/I‑D‑S).** | `U.Discipline` names **SHALL** follow **LEX** (twin labels; registers; banned heads). **Domain** mentions are catalog‑only. | Register hygiene; avoid “Domain = Discipline”. |
| **CC‑C20‑7 (ATS hooks).** | Any **Tier‑crossing reference** in Discipline materials **SHALL** pass **AH‑2 GateCheck**/**AH‑3 LaneCheck**/**AH‑4 LexicalCheck** (E.11/G.13) and publish a **UTS row** for the crossing (_no implicit crossings_). |
| **CC‑C20‑8 (Discipline column is didactic).** | Any use of a “discipline column” in tables is **didactic only**; semantics are carried by **UTS rows + Bridges**; **Domain** remains a catalog stitch (**E.10/F.17**). |  |
| **CC‑C20‑9 (Lexical firewall).** | Normative sections remain **notation/tool‑neutral**; vendor/tool tokens are avoided (see **E.5.1**). |  |

#### 7.1 Canonical rewrites (anti‑ambiguity)
* “TDD discipline” → **`Tradition: Test‑Driven`** *(Plain twin keeps “Tradition”)*.  
* “Safety Discipline Owner” → **`Holder#DisciplineStewardRole:Safety‑Context`**.  
* “ClinicalSafetyDomain Governance” → **`DisciplineSpec: Clinical‑Safety`** with comparability in **CG‑Spec**; the **Domain** mention remains a **D.CTX + UTS** catalog stitch.

### 8 · Consequences
**Benefits.** Auditable field composition; lawful federation across traditions; selector‑ready maturity/evidence linkage; didactic surface for stewardship.  
+**Trade‑offs.** Discipline authoring requires CG‑Spec literacy and Bridge hygiene; paid back by safe reuse and clearer governance.

### 9 · Rationale
The calculus keeps **describedEntity local**, **comparability lawful**, and **assurance explicit**. It aligns with KD‑CAL’s weak‑link folds and CL routing, with CG‑Spec’s gauge/Γ‑fold Standard, and with LEX twin‑label governance. It avoids “phlogiston disciplines” by tying fields to measurable CHRs (C.21) and evidence lanes.

### 10 · Relations
**Builds on.** KD‑CAL (C.2); CG‑Spec (A.19/G.0); Bridges (F.9); LEX (E.10).  
**Coordinates with.** C.21 (field‑health CHRs), C.22 (Problem‑CHR), C.23 (Method‑SoS‑LOG).  
**Constrains.** G.2 **MUST** publish **TraditionCards**/**BridgeMatrix** sufficient for `Γ_disc` to assemble **≥2 Traditions** and **≥3 `U.BoundedContext`** per SoTA synthesis to avoid monoculture. G.5 selector **SHALL** cite Discipline **CG‑Spec ids** and **EvidenceGraph** rows when admitting families.

## C.21 — **Discipline-CHR · Field Health & Structure**  \[A] 

> *Purpose.* Give FPF a **typed, auditable** way to speak about the *health, maturity, and structure* of a scientific/engineering **discipline**, without collapsing into taste, anecdotes, or single-number scores. The pattern defines a **portable set of Characteristics** and guards (legality, freshness, scope) that any Context can specialize.

*This pattern supplies the CHR “vocabulary of health” for disciplines. C.20 composes the discipline; C.21 measures its health; Part G (G.2, G.12) harvests SoTA and operationalizes dashboards; Bridges keep meaning honest; penalties touch **R** only.*

 **Status & placement.** Part C (Architheory Specifications) → Cluster C.I (Core CHRs/CALs). 
  **Depends on:** **MM-CHR** (C.16), **KD-CAL** (C.2), **USM/Scope** (A.2.6), **Trust & Assurance** (B.3), **E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE)**. 
  **Coordinates with:** **C.20 Discipline‑CAL** (what a `U.Discipline` is), **G.2** (SoTA palette), **G.12** (dashboard), **G.0** (CG‑Spec registry).

### 1 · Problem Frame

FPF treats *disciplines* as first-class holons (see **C.20**): they aggregate epistemes, practices, standards, institutions, and observed Work. Teams routinely say “the field is fragmented,” “standards are converging,” or “replication is improving,” but these claims are rarely **typed** (scale/unit/polarity) or **auditable** (evidence lanes, freshness, scope). C.21 supplies the CHR layer—named Characteristics with CSLC typing—so disciplines can be compared lawfully (CG‑Spec) and monitored through time (G.12).  Each published value MUST declare ReferencePlane ∈ {world|concept|episteme} and DisciplineId (U.Discipline@UTS); cross‑plane use applies CL^plane in Assurance (penalty to R_eff only). 

### 2 · Problem

Narrative health claims cause three recurrent failure modes:

1. **Illegality.** Averaging ordinals, mixing units, or comparing incommensurate Contexts ⇒ nonsense roll-ups.
2. **Staleness.** Health “scores” rarely declare **freshness windows** or evidence lanes (TA/VA/LA).
3. **Scope slippage.** “The field” is left implicit; cross-Context reuse lacks **Bridges & CL**, leading to silent semantic loss. Any numeric comparison/aggregation MUST cite a **CG‑Spec** row (characteristics, lawful gauge/Γ‑fold, MinimalEvidence) before computation.

### 3 · Forces

| Force                            | Tension                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comparability vs nuance**      | Need global pictures without erasing local meaning (Context, traditions, cohorts).                                         |
| **Ordinal vs interval/ratio**    | Powerful stats tempt illegal ops on ranks and categories.                                                                  |
| **Local evidence vs federation** | Health must be computed *in room* (Context slice) yet projectable across rooms via Bridges & CL (penalties to **R** only). |
| **Recency vs stability**         | Health evolves; dashboards must reflect **freshness**, not just cumulative history.                                        |

### 4 · Solution — **Discipline Health Characterisation (DHC)**

#### 4.0 · Ontology quick sheet (normative, clarifying)
**What “DHC” is.** DHC is a **CHR vocabulary pack** (intensional) that defines **Characteristics** + **Scales/Units/Polarity** for discipline health; it is not a document or a run.
**Artifacts.**
• **`U.DHCPack`** (I‑layer name; published as an episteme): the **slot set** (Characteristic/Scale declarations) for a Context.  
• **`U.DHCMethodSpec`** (S‑layer): the **computational specification(s)** for deriving each DHC slot (e.g., replication‑window definition, CD‑index class), table‑backed; multiple per slot allowed, editioned separately.  
• **`U.DHCSeries`** (episteme w/ `EditionSeries`): a **time‑indexed publication** of computed DHC readings for a Discipline×Context, each value bound to `…Ref.edition` for every referenced method/metric/distance.
**Edition subjects.**  
(i) **DHCPack.edition** — when the **slot semantics** (Characteristic/Scale) change.  
(ii) **DHCMethodSpecRef.edition** — when a **computation method** (formula/class/policy) changes.  
(iii) **DHCSeries.edition** — when the **published series** changes its content (not carriers).  
**Publication.** Releases are **Work** on Carriers; **no** edition change unless content changes per `U.EditionSeries`.  
**Ref discipline.** All bindings to packs/methods/distances **SHALL** use `…Ref.edition` (dot on the Ref).

Define a **portable minimal set** of CHR **slots**. Each slot is **CHR-typed** (Characteristic, Scale/Unit/Polarity per **A.17–A.18**), **Context-local**, and guarded by **USM** (Claim scope **G**), **freshness windows**, and **evidence lanes** (TA/VA/LA).  Contexts MAY extend the set; MUST NOT alter scale types illegally. 

**“Health” is a vector** of CHR‑typed coordinates; **no single scalar** is implied. Lawful scalarization lives in **Acceptance** (G.4) with an explicit gauge/Γ‑fold and is never embedded in CHR.

#### 4.1 Core Characteristics (kernel-portable names)

1. **ReproducibilityRate** *(ratio ∈ [0,1]; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG‑Spec‑bound)*
   Fraction of tested claims/benchmarks that independent teams **replicate** under a declared **ContextSlice** and **Γ\_time** window. **Lane tags:** LA (validation) with TA (typing) for protocols.

2. **StandardisationLevel** *(ordinal; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme)*
   {none, *emerging*, *de facto*, *de jure*}. **No mean.** Use medoid/mode; legal comparisons are ≤/=/> only. Tracks convergence on vocabularies, interfaces, or procedures.

3. **AlignmentDensity** *(ratio; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG‑Spec‑bound)*  
   Density of **Substitution Bridges** (same **senseFamily**, CL≥2) between major `U.Tradition`s **per 100 DHC‑SenseCells** (G.2 F‑hooks) in the SoTA palette.  Substitution rule:  free substitution permitted at **CL=3**; at **CL=2** substitute only with extra‑guard (count in reporting, but this is not «free substitution») Units: `bridges_per_100_cells`. Cross‑Context use requires Bridge+CL; penalties → **R_eff** only.

 4. **DisruptionBalance** *(interval; polarity = target band; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG‑Spec‑bound)*  
  Relative share of **disruptive vs consolidating** works within **Γ_time** using a **registered CD‑index class** (editioned; cite **method id** in UTS). **Default plane:** *episteme*. Publish the **target band** via **Acceptance (G.4)**; not in CHR.
   
  5. **EvidenceGranularity** *(Context-declared: ordinal|ratio; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme)*  
   If ratio: units = `claims_per_artifact` or `anchors_per_claim` (declare). If ordinal: publish level names and **ORD_COMPARE_ONLY**.
   Fineness of evidential units and declared envelopes (experiment cards, benchmark tasks, audit granules). Encourages *smaller, well-scoped* claims over monoliths.

  6. **MetaDiversity** *(portfolio dispersion; polarity ↑ to band; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG‑Spec‑bound)*  
  Use entropy/HHI **over MethodFamily/Tradition shares** (method edition id в UTS); publish **guard‑band** as **Acceptance** binding; cross‑ordinal scalarisation is forbidden.
  Entropy/Herfindahl-type dispersion across `U.Tradition`s, method families, or data regimes, bounded by a **Context-declared guard-band** (too low ⇒ monoculture; too high ⇒ incoherence).

> **Typing & legality.** Each slot **MUST** declare **Scale/Unit/Polarity**; illegal ops (e.g., mean on ordinals; unit mixing) are **fail-fast** per **A.18/MM-CHR**.

#### 4.2 Guard Macros (normative)

* **ORD\_COMPARE\_ONLY(x)** — for **StandardisationLevel** (ordinal).
* **UNIT\_CHECK(x)** — forbid cross-unit aggregation (AlignmentDensity, ReproducibilityRate).
* **POLARITY_CHECK(x)** — enforce declared polarity (↑/↓/target-band) per MM‑CHR.
* **FRESHNESS(x; window)** — ensure values come from evidence within declared **Γ_time**; record **valid_until**; stale ⇒ {degrade|abstain} at Acceptance.
* **PLANE_NOTE(x)** — record **ReferencePlane**; compute **CL^plane** on crossings; penalties → **R_eff** only.
* **LANE\_TAGS(x; {TA|VA|LA})** — annotate contribution lanes.
* **SCOPE\_COVERS(x; TargetSlice)** — enforce **USM** coverage of the computation.
* **BRIDGE_CL(x; id, CL≥k)** — on cross‑Context roll‑ups, require **Bridge** with **CL**; penalties route to **R** only. If planes differ, apply **CL^plane** and cite **Φ_plane** policy id. **Hint:** for **AlignmentDensity** reporting, set **k=2** (CL≥2); **CL=3** counts as *free substitution*.

#### 4.3 Legality Matrix (extract)

| Operation     | ReproducibilityRate (ratio) | StandardisationLevel (ordinal) | AlignmentDensity (ratio) | DisruptionBalance (interval) |
| ------------- | --------------------------: | -----------------------------: | -----------------------: | ---------------------------: |
| mean          |                      **OK** |                     **FORBID** |                   **OK** |                       **OK** |
| median        |                          OK |                         **OK** |                       OK |                           OK |
| compare (<,>) |                          OK |                         **OK** |                       OK |                           OK |

*Note:* For **MetaDiversity/EvidenceGranularity (ordinal)** use **median/mode**; forbid affine ops; unit mix always fails.

### 5 · Interfaces & Data Paths

* **Inputs.** `U.Discipline` from **C.20** (composition), SoTA **Palette**/**BridgeMatrix** from **G.2** (**DHC‑SenseCells** included), EvidenceProfiles from **G.4/G.6**.
* **Outputs.** Per‑Context **DHC rows** (these six slots), **UTS** Name Cards with twin labels (E.5/F.17–F.18), **Registry/RSCR hooks** on method edition changes; feeds **G.12** (time‑series).
* **Cross-Context reuse.** Only via **F.9 Bridges** with **CL** and **loss notes**; **Φ(CL)** penalties applied to **R** (never F/G).

### 6 · Archetypal Grounding (three fields)

#### 6.1 Computer Vision (Benchmarks 2015→)
* **ReproducibilityRate.** Ratio of independently reproduced results on ImageNet-style tasks within **rolling 24 mo** (LA lane).
* **StandardisationLevel.** *de facto* for dataset specs and metrics in *Vision\_2024*; *emerging* for robustness protocols.
* **DisruptionBalance.** Use an editioned CD‑index class (e.g., Wu‑style disruption family) with method id; publish target band via Acceptance; annotate ReferencePlane=episteme.
* **AlignmentDensity.** Bridges with **CL≥2** across sub-traditions (supervised vs self-supervised).
* **MetaDiversity.** Entropy across method families (CNN/ViT/Hybrid) kept within guard-band to avoid monoculture.

#### 6.2 Biomedicine (Gene–Disease Associations)
* **ReproducibilityRate.** Fraction of associations replicated in independent cohorts within **Γ\_time(36 mo)**; LA lane with TA (typing of protocols).
* **StandardisationLevel.** *de jure* for certain reporting guidelines; *emerging* for pre-registration norms.
* **EvidenceGranularity.** Move from “paper-level” to *claim-level* units (Context raises the score).
* **DisruptionBalance.** Target band discourages sustained “novelty spikes” unbacked by replication.

#### 6.3 Software Performance Engineering (SPE)
* **StandardisationLevel.** *emerging* → *de facto* for SLO taxonomies and trace schemas across vendors.
* **AlignmentDensity.** CL-rated Bridges between tracing ecosystems.
* **ReproducibilityRate.** Share of publicly replicable perf claims in rolling windows.
* **MetaDiversity.** Balance across load models, failure modes, and toolchains.

#### 6.4 Decision‑Making (2015→)
• ReproducibilityRate — share of causal effect estimates replicated across independent datasets within Γ_time; LA lane.
• StandardisationLevel — *emerging* for identification checklists; *de facto* for SCM notation in leading stacks (ordinal; no means).
• AlignmentDensity — CL‑rated Bridges between SCM/DoWhy‑style and RL/BO traditions per 100 DHC‑SenseCells.
• MetaDiversity — dispersion across method families (SCM/RL/BO/DT) within guard‑band; entropy/HHI (units declared in CG‑Spec).

#### 6.5 Evolutionary Architecture (software)
• ReproducibilityRate — fraction of architecture fitness results reproduced on independent workloads (rolling 18–24 mo; LA lane).
• StandardisationLevel — *de facto* for ADR/ATAM patterns; *emerging* for continuous fitness protocols.
• AlignmentDensity — Bridges across ATAM/SAAM/ADR style guides (CL≥2) normalised per 100 DHC‑SenseCells.
• MetaDiversity — portfolio dispersion across patterns (microservices, event‑driven, layered) with guard‑bands; no ordinal arithmetic.

### 7 · Measurement & Publication Procedure (authoring harness)

1. **Declare Context & TargetSlice.** (USM) Name editions, Standards, env params, `Γ_time`.
2. **Collect evidence.** Bind sources via **G.6 EvidenceGraph**; tag lanes and freshness.
3. **Compute DHC slots.** Enforce **Legality Matrix** and Guard Macros.
4. **Bridge (if needed).** Map via **F.9**; attach **CL** and **loss notes**; apply **R** penalties.
5. **Publish to UTS.** Name Cards (Tech/Plain), twin labels; **bind `DHCMethodSpecRef.edition`**, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, and, where templates are used, `DHCMethodRef.edition`; register RSCR triggers (method change, gauge edits).
6. **Dashboard.** Feed G.12 with time-series and guard-bands (disruption, diversity).

### 8 · Bias-Annotation (E-cluster lenses)

* **Didactic.** Plain names + twin labels; one-screen tables for managers.
* **Architectural.** No ordinals averaged; all cross-Context movement goes through Bridges+CL; penalties never touch F/G.
* **Pragmatic.** Freshness-aware; unknowns tri-state; values are decision-support, not trophies.
* **Epistemic.** Evidence lanes explicit; reproducibility is LA, typing is TA; validation distinct from verification in dashboards.

### 9 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC-C.21-1 (CHR typing).** Every DHC slot **MUST** declare **Characteristic + Scale/Unit/Polarity**, with CSLC legality proved before any aggregation.
**CC-C.21-2 (Freshness).** Published values MUST carry Γ_time selector and freshness window; stale rows escalate to {degrade|abstain} in **G.4 Acceptance**.
**CC-C.21-3 (Plane).** ReferencePlane declared; cross‑plane re‑use publishes **CL^plane** (policy id) alongside CL; both penalties route to **R_eff**.
**CC‑C.21‑4 (DesignRunTag).** Every DHC row SHALL declare **DesignRunTag ∈ {design, run}**; design‑ и run‑characteristics **not mixing** in one value/aggregate.
**CC-C.21-5 (Lane tags).** Each value **MUST** tag **TA/VA/LA** lanes of contributing evidence.
**CC-C.21-6 (Ordinal discipline).** **StandardisationLevel** is ordinal; **no means**, **no z-scores**.
**CC-C.21-7 (Scope).** All computations declare **TargetSlice**; **USM** membership is decidable and deterministic.
**CC-C.21-8 (Bridges).** Cross-Context comparisons/publishers **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL**; penalties route to **R\_eff**, never to F/G.
**CC-C.21-9 (UTS).** Publish DHC rows as **UTS Name Cards** with **twin labels** (Tech/Plain).
**CC‑C.21‑10 (Registry).** DHC methods are table-backed; silent method changes are forbidden (**bump `DHCMethodSpecRef.edition` + RSCR trigger**). 
**CC-C.21-11 (Unknowns).** Unknown inputs propagate tri-state {pass|degrade|abstain} to Acceptance; **no `unknown→0` coercion**.
**CC-C.21-12 (No tool/vendor tokens).** Core narrative follows **E.5.1** (Lexical Firewall).
**CC-C.21-13 (CG‑Spec citation).** Any numeric operation (comparison/aggregation) in DHC **MUST** refer to **CG‑Spec** (characteristics, gauge/Γ‑fold, MinimalEvidence).
**CC-C.21-14 (Φ‑policies).** **Φ(CL)** и **Φ_plane** — **monotone** and **table‑backed**; published by policy id.
**CC‑C.21‑15 (Ref discipline).** Any edition pinning **SHALL** appear as `…Ref.edition` on the relevant reference field (DHCPack/MethodSpec/DistanceDef/DHCMethodRef); bare `…Edition` fields are non‑conformant.
**CC‑C.21‑16 (Role kit, informative).** Use standard roles from F.4: `DisciplineStewardRole` (governs DHCPack), `DHCMethodAuthorRole`, `DHCSeriesPublisherRole`. Roles are **design‑time**; values are **run‑ or design‑stance** per slot and must declare **ReferencePlane**.

### 10 · Consequences

**Benefits.** Lawful comparisons; freshness-aware governance; explicit cross-tradition alignment; dashboards that don’t lie by averaging ranks.
**Costs.** Some ceremony (scales, windows, lanes, bridges), offset by template macros and UTS automation.
**Risks avoided.** “Phlogiston disciplines” (charisma-driven fields) fail DHC audits; **No-Free-Lunch** preserved by G.5 (selector returns sets, not universal scalars).

### 11 · Rationale (post-2015 signals & practice)

* **Replication & credibility (2015→).** Field-level health in SciSci emphasizes **replicability**, *fresh* evidence windows, and claim-level units—captured by **ReproducibilityRate** and **EvidenceGranularity**.
* **Disruption vs consolidation (2019→).** Empirical “disruption indices” distinguish papers that open new lines from those that refine—hence **DisruptionBalance** with *target bands*, not monotone “more is better.”
* **Standardization waves (2016→).** Package/ecosystem norms show ordinal trajectories (none→emerging→de facto→de jure); **ordinal typing** prevents illegal arithmetic.
* **Plural traditions (ongoing).** Mature fields maintain **bridges** with explicit **loss notes**; **AlignmentDensity** rewards CL-rated bridges without semantic collapse.

*(Names are illustrative of contemporary practice; the CHR is notation-agnostic and tool-neutral.)*

### 12 · Relations

* **Builds on:** **A.17–A.18** (Characteristic/CSLC), **A.2.6** (USM scopes), **B.3** (assurance lanes), **C.16** (MM-CHR templates).
* **Coordinates with:** **C.20** (what a `U.Discipline` *is*), **G.2** (SoTA palette and BridgeMatrix), **G.12** (Dashboard operationalization), **G.9** (parity harness for fair comparisons).
* **Constrains:** **G.10** (pack ships DHC rows + method ids), **G.11** (refresh windows/decay), **G.5** (selector may reference DHC only via admissible predicates; no cross‑ordinal scalarisation). **Coordinates:** **F.9** (Bridges for cross‑Tradition comparisons).

## C.22 — **Problem‑CHR · Problem Typing & TaskSignature Binding**  \[A] 

**Purpose.** Give FPF a **lawful, minimal, and portable** way to speak about “the problem we face” so that the **selector** (G.5) can legally admit/abstain without prose or guesswork. We do this by (i) **typing problems** with CHR‑grounded traits and (ii) **binding** them to a **TaskSignature (S2)** that downstream architheories can consume. The Standard is **Context‑local**, evidence‑anchored, tri‑state‑aware, and bridge‑savvy. TaskSignature is *minimal* but sufficient for **eligibility**, **acceptance**, and **policy‑governed** choice. 

**Status & placement.** Part C (Architheory Specifications) → Cluster C.I (Core CHRs/CALs).
**Depends on:** **C.16 MM‑CHR** (measurement legality), **G.5** (selector S2/S3), **G.0** (CG‑Spec invariants).
**Coordinates with:** **G.4** (Acceptance/Evidence profiles), **C.23** (MethodFamily admissibility & maturity), **C.18 NQD‑CAL** (QD/illumination), **C.19 E/E‑LOG** (emitters/policies), **E.10** (LEX).

### 1) Intent

Operationalise No‑Free‑Lunch discipline in selection by ensuring every run‑time decision sees a **typed TaskSignature (S2)**, not a paragraph, and that **“problem”** (method unknown) is cleanly separated from **“task”** (method known; signature bound). The signature is the **smallest CHR‑typed set** sufficient to drive **Eligibility → Acceptance → policy‑governed selection** without illegal arithmetic or silent coercions; crossings are auditable (Bridge+CL → **R_eff only**).

### 2) Problem Frame (design/run split; ATS‑aware)

**method‑first stance**
In FPF a **Problem** exists when a Holder or external **Transformer** cannot cite a known **Method** (or specialisation thereof) that satisfies the current **TaskSignature** under the declared **ScopeSlice(G)**. Problem‑solving therefore entails **strategizing** (selecting or synthesising a method). The resulting **strategy/policy** is a composition under **G.5/E/E‑LOG** and **is not** a new kernel type.  
**Unknown‑first discipline.** Author S2 with `unknown` traits rather than coercions; **SoS‑LOG** branches MUST specify `{admit|degrade|abstain|sandbox}` handling for `unknown` via closed enums registered at UTS.

Un‑typed “problems” collapse into **informal prose**; selectors cannot **filter/abstain** lawfully; thresholds leak into scoring; cross‑Context reuse is by name, not Bridge. We need a Context‑local descriptor that (i) obeys **MM‑CHR legality** (Scale/Unit/Polarity proven before any aggregation), (ii) records **Assurance lanes (TA/VA/LA)** per **A.10** and **ReferencePlane**, (iii) carries **tri‑state unknowns** explicitly, and (iv) **publishes ATS crossings** (Bridge + UTS) with **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane policy ids**.

### 3) Problem

Without typed descriptors, **Eligibility/Acceptance** degenerate into prose; **illegal ops** creep in (ordinal means; unit mixing); **cross‑plane comparisons** lose **CL/Φ** routing (**penalties to R_eff only**). 

### 4) Forces

| Force                        | Tension                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs sufficiency** | Fewer fields to avoid ceremony **vs** enough to drive lawful gating.                                                              |
| **Unknowns**                 | Many traits are **unknown** at intake → tri‑state semantics must propagate to Acceptance without silent coercions.                |
| **CHR legality**             | **No mean on ordinals; no unit mixing**; polarity & scale type must be declared *before* aggregation.                             |
| **Locality vs portability**  | Problem is **in‑room**; still must cross **via Bridges**, with **CL** and (if planes differ) **CL^plane** penalties → **R** only. |

---

### 5) Solution — **Problem‑CHR** (fields) + **TaskSignature (S2) binding** *(normative)*

#### 5.1 Minimal CHR fields (tri‑state aware).
Each field is **CHR‑typed** (Characteristic/Scale/Unit/Polarity; MM‑CHR discipline). Every predicate admits `unknown` (tri‑state). Unknowns must propagate to {degrade|abstain|sandbox} per Acceptance/EvidenceProfile policy (recorded in SCR). (G.4/G.6 alignment)

* **`DataShape`** — data regime & admissible transforms (e.g., tabular, sequence, graph; density; stationarity claims).
* **`NoiseModel`** — uncertainty class / robustness envelope (e.g., iid Gaussian; heavy‑tailed; adversarial budget).
* **`ObjectiveProfile`** — objective heads (**Scale/Unit/Polarity** and **ReferencePlane** declared), polarity, and **lawful orders** (lexicographic, Pareto, medoid/median where legal). **Weighted sums across mixed scale types are forbidden**; ordinal heads use order‑only guards. For QD tasks, explicitly enumerate **Q (quality)**, **D (diversity)**, and **QD‑score** heads; see **DominanceRegime** below.
* `RegularityTraits` — method‑relevant structure (**convexity/differentiability/separability/monotonicity**) as CHR‑typed predicates with guard‑macros (e.g., `ORD_COMPARE_ONLY`, `UNIT_CHECK`, `POLARITY_CHECK`). Include `ConditionClass` (e.g., stiffness/κ‑proxies) where applicable.
* **`Constraints`** — explicit hard/soft constraint classes (feasibility predicates; **ResourceEnvelope**/**RiskEnvelope**). **Thresholds live in Acceptance (G.4) only; never inside CHR or code paths.**
* **`ShiftClass/Stationarity`** — CHR‑typed claims about regime stability (iid | covariate‑shift | concept‑drift | adversarial). Default=`unknown`. Acceptance/Flows MUST honor this in gating or abstain.
* `EvidenceGraphRef (A.10)` — carriers & **lane tags (TA/VA/LA)** with **freshness windows**; **no self‑evidence**; default Γ‑fold = **weakest‑link** unless CAL proves an alternative.
* `ScopeSlice(G)` — **USM** slice of **describedEntity/scope** to bound claims (discipline governance in **CG‑Spec**; Domain is a catalog mark only).
* `Size/Scale` — size/condition proxies (**n, m, κ, sparsity**) with **declared units**; unit mismatch ⇒ {sandbox|refuse}.
* **`Freshness`** — validity window for descriptors.
* `Missingness` — **MCAR/MAR/MNAR** (or mapped equivalents) per **CHR.Missingness**; MUST be honoured by Acceptance/Flows.
* `KindSet` — **`U.Kind[]`** of objects‑of‑talk addressed by the TaskKind; separates **describedEntity (Kind)** from **Scope (USM)**.

**QD / Illumination extensions (normative; ties to C.18/C.19).**
* **`CharacteristicSpaceRef`** — reference to **`U.CharacteristicSpace`**, with declared **d≥2**; **characteristics are CHR‑typed**; **ReferencePlane** per characteristic; pin edition via **`CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition`**.
* **`ArchiveConfig`** — archive **topology** (grid/CVT/graph), **resolution** (bins/centroids), **K‑capacity**, **`InsertionPolicyRef`** (elite replacement/dedup/novelty), and **`DistanceDefRef.edition`** (declare **metric/pseudometric** status and invariances; any normalisation **MUST** cite lawful scale transforms in **CG‑Spec**); legality follows CG‑Spec.
* **`EmitterPolicyRef`** — pointer to emitter/governor policy (C.19) applicable to this TaskSignature; **edition id** recorded.
* **`DominanceRegime`** — `{ParetoOnly | ParetoPlusIllumination}`. **Default = `ParetoOnly`** (illumination remains a gauge unless CAL explicitly authorises `ParetoPlusIllumination`, policy‑id cited).
* **`IlluminationSummary`** — a **gauge over `Diversity_P`**; **published** by default; excluded from dominance unless a CAL enables `ParetoPlusIllumination` (policy‑id cited).
* **`IlluminationMap`** *(parity‑run)* — required **publication artefact** (grid/CVT/graph per `ArchiveConfig`) recording coverage per niche/cell with `DescriptorMapRef`/`DistanceDefRef.edition`. **Leaderboards as single‑score lists are forbidden**; comparisons **MUST** be under CG‑frames.
* **`PortfolioMode`** — `{Pareto | Archive}`. **Default = `Archive`**: selectors **publish portfolios** (QD archives) rather than a single “best” set; ε‑fronts remain admissible for local decisions under CG‑Spec.
* **`Budgeting`** — evaluation/time/batch **budgets**, including **E/E‑LOG exploration budget** id; units declared (CG‑Spec).
* **`TelemetryHooks`** — **PathSliceId**, **decay/refresh policy ids**, and **edition counters** to record **U.DescriptorMap** and **policy‑id** updates upon illumination gains.
* **`GeneratorIntent`** (OEE) — optional intent to invoke a **`GeneratorFamily`** (G.5) with pointers to **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`**, **`TransferRulesRef`**, and **coverage/regret** reporting expectations.

**Legality.** Before any numeric comparison/aggregation, **prove CSLC legality** (Scale/Unit/Polarity) and **cite CG‑Spec.Characteristics**; publish **ReferencePlane**. **Unknowns** propagate as {degrade|abstain|sandbox}; **no `unknown→0/false` coercions**.

#### 5.2 TaskSignature (S2) — binding definition (design‑time + run‑time).
A TaskSignature is a minimal typed record the selector consumes:
`⟨Context, TaskKind, KindSet:U.Kind[], DataShape, NoiseModel, ObjectiveProfile, Constraints{incl. Resource/Risk Envelopes}, ScopeSlice(G), EvidenceGraphRef, Size/Scale, Freshness, Missingness, ShiftClass?, BehaviorSpaceRef?, ArchiveConfig?, EmitterPolicyRef?, DominanceRegime?, PortfolioMode?, Budgeting?, TelemetryHooks?, GeneratorIntent?⟩`


**Minimality rule.** S2 carries only fields required for **Eligibility→Acceptance→lawful selection**; any additional traits derived at design‑time are published as provenance (UTS) but **do not expand S2**. 

Values are **CHR‑typed** with **provenance**; traits may be **inferred** from CHR/CAL bindings (e.g., *convexity known? differentiable? ordinal vs interval scales?*) and from **USM** scope metadata. Unknowns are tri‑state; **Missingness semantics MUST align with CHR.Missingness** and be honored by Acceptance/Flows. 

**Design/Run hygiene.** Do not mix DesignRunTag in one signature; **publish ATS crossings** (Bridge + UTS) when importing design‑time traits into run‑time.

#### 5.3 Provenance & planes.
Record **Context**, **ReferencePlane** for each value; on any cross‑Context/plane reuse, attach BridgeDescription + UTS row, apply **CL** (and, if planes differ, **CL^plane**) penalties to **R_eff only**; both **Φ(CL)** and (if used) **Φ_plane** MUST be **monotone, bounded, and table‑backed**; **no “distance” language; penalties never mutate F/G.** Publish policy‑ids in SCR and cite Bridge ids on crossings.

#### 5.4 Binding & use.

* **Eligibility** gates read TaskSignature against each **MethodFamily.Eligibility** (C.23) and **CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence** for referenced characteristics.
* **Acceptance** clauses (G.4) use these fields for **threshold predicates** (thresholds live in Acceptance only).
* **Selection kernel** (G.5.S3) applies a **lawful order** (often partial); **weighted sums across mixed scale types are forbidden**. If only a partial order remains, **return a Pareto (non‑dominated) set** with tie notes. If `PortfolioMode=Archive`, the selector **may** return a **QD archive** (per `ArchiveConfig`) **in addition to** or **instead of** a Pareto set. **Illumination** enters dominance **only** if `DominanceRegime=ParetoPlusIllumination` is **enabled by CAL** (policy id cited); otherwise, QD metrics are **reported** but **excluded** from dominance.
* When `GeneratorIntent` is present, G.5 may dispatch to a registered **`GeneratorFamily`** (POET‑class); the selection surface becomes **pairs** `{environment, method}`, with Environment guarded by **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`** and **`TransferRulesRef`** (C.23 wiring). Report **`IlluminationSummary`** as a **gauge over `Diversity_P`** in telemetry; dominance remains unaffected unless policy changes as above.

#### 5.5 Unknowns.
Every field supports `unknown`; downstream **degrade/abstain/sandbox** behavior is explicit per Acceptance/EvidenceProfile; no implicit coercions. 

#### 5.6 Publication.
Emit a **ProblemProfile** (…Description) that carries the bound TaskSignature, **UTS** Name Cards for any minted values (twin labels), and SCR‑visible provenance (A.10 anchors, lane tags, freshness, **ReferencePlane**). **Mark any vendor/tool examples as Plain‑register only (LEX V‑4); they are non‑normative.**

#### 5.7 Open‑Ended tasks (GeneratorFamily) *(normative)*.
If the problem requires **open‑ended generation** of tasks/environments, S2 **SHALL** include `GeneratorIntent` with pointers to **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`** (lawful support of generated environments), **`TransferRulesRef`** (cross‑environment transfer constraints), and **coverage/regret** telemetry expectations. Selector outputs are then portfolios over **{environment, method}**; **coverage** and **IlluminationSummary** are **gauges** (reported) unless **CAL** authorises their participation in dominance (see `DominanceRegime`). Edition increments of **CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition**/**DistanceDefRef.edition** and the **policy‑id** that caused illumination increases **SHALL** be recorded in SCR.


### 6) Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

*Tell–Show–Show hook (per E.8):* label examples as **Show‑1 (continuous ODE)** and **Show‑2 (MIP)** and cite CHR guard‑macros in‑line so engineers can see **which field drove which gate**.  **Explicitly annotate which S2 fields triggered each Eligibility/Acceptance decision** (e.g., `service_level@ordinal → ORD_COMPARE_ONLY`, `budget@ratio → unit alignment check`).

**A. Differential equations (continuous systems, solver choice).**
*ProblemProfile.* `DataShape=ODE, stiff?=unknown, Size/Scale={n≈10^3}, ObjectiveProfile={↓error@ratio, ↑throughput@ratio}, Constraints={budget≤X, safety_gate@ordinal}, RegularityTraits={Lipschitz known?=unknown, Jacobian sparsity=high}, Missingness=MAR`.
*Binding.* Selector reads TaskSignature; **eligibility** filters MethodFamilies that require known stiffness or differentiability (unknown ⇒ **degrade/abstain** per family); **Acceptance** enforces `safety_gate` as **ordinal predicate**, not averaged (ORD\_COMPARE\_ONLY), and budgets with **unit‑aligned sums** (ratio). The selector returns a **Pareto set**; no cross‑ordinal weighting.

**B. Mixed‑integer optimisation (planning/scheduling).**
*ProblemProfile.* `DataShape=MIP, NoiseModel=deterministic, ObjectiveProfile={↓cost@ratio, ↑service_level@ordinal}, Constraints={SLA hard, workforce soft}, RegularityTraits={convex_relaxation=available}, Size/Scale={vars~10^5}, Missingness=MCAR`.
*Binding.* **CG‑Spec** forbids means over **service\_level** (ordinal); **Acceptance** holds thresholds; **Eligibility** checks convex‑relaxation availability; **Selection** applies **lexicographic** guard (assumption‑fit ≻ evidence‑fit ≻ resource), compute **R\_eff** with Γ‑fold, route **CL** to **R** only; if partial order remains, return a **Pareto set**.

> *Contemporary anchors (informative):* modern **Julia** ecosystems illustrate the “**general call outside, specialised implementations inside**” ethos (e.g., DifferentialEquations.jl, JuMP), aligning with C.22→G.5 multi‑method dispatch under NFL.

**C. Quality‑Diversity portfolio (illumination).**
*ProblemProfile.* `DataShape=policy‑search; ObjectiveProfile={↑reward@ratio, ↑coverage@ratio (report‑only)}, DominanceRegime=ParetoOnly, PortfolioMode=Archive, CharacteristicSpaceRef(d=3, characteristics=CHR‑typed), ArchiveConfig(grid, res=32×32×16, K=1, InsertionPolicyRef=elite‑replace, DistanceDefRef.edition=v1), EmitterPolicyRef=v2, Budgeting{eval=1e6}, TelemetryHooks{PathSliceId=…}`.
*Binding.* Selector may return an **archive**; **coverage/illumination** are **reported** but **excluded** from dominance (default). Any change of `DistanceDefRef.edition`/Emitter policy is **editioned** and logged in SCR.

**D. Open‑ended environment generation (POET‑class).**
*ProblemProfile.* `GeneratorIntent{GeneratorFamilyRef=…, EnvironmentValidityRegion=… (CHR‑typed), TransferRulesRef=…, CoverageMetric=…}`, `PortfolioMode=Archive`.
*Binding.* Selector outputs **{environment, method}** pairs that pass Eligibility; **TransferRules** govern cross‑environment policy reuse; telemetry reports **coverage/regret** and **IlluminationSummary** with **edition/policy‑id** when improved.

### 7) Bias‑Annotation (LEX/discipline guards)

* **No minted “Strategy” head.** “Strategy/policy” are *roles/lenses* inside G.5; do **not** introduce a new `U.Type` “Strategy”.
* **No minted `U.Type` “Strategy”.** Strategy/policy are roles/lenses inside G.5 Compose under E/E‑LOG; keep “strategy” as Plain where pedagogically needed.
* **Transdiscipline vs domain.** Comparability flows through **`U.Discipline` CG‑Spec**; “Domain” is a catalog mark stitched to D.CTX + UTS; do **not** attach norms to Domain labels.
* **Plain twins & head‑anchoring.** Use Description/Spec morphology correctly (I/D/S; E.10.D2). 

### 8) Anti‑patterns (normative):
* **AP‑1** Pre‑binding a Method into S2 (“problem as if task”); **Remedy:** keep S2 method‑agnostic; bind only lawful traits.
* **AP‑2** Silent `unknown→false/0` in Eligibility/Acceptance.  
* **AP‑3** Cross‑ordinal averaging / ordinal–interval scalar mixes.  
* **AP‑4** **Design/run chimera** signatures (mixing stances).  
* **AP‑5** **Domain** treated as governance (attach governance to **U.Discipline/CG‑Spec**, not Domain).  
* **AP‑6** Implicit handling of data‑shift (assume iid); **Remedy:** declare `ShiftClass` (or `unknown`) and gate via Acceptance.
* **AP‑7** Tool/vendor tokens in normative text; **Remedy:** move to Plain‑register note; keep Tech anchors on CHR/CAL ids (LEX V‑4).

**Remedies:** tri‑state predicates; lawful orders (lexi/Pareto/median/medoid); ATS crossing with Bridge+CL; Domain stitched to **D.CTX + UTS** only.

### 9) Conformance Checklist (normative)

0. **Minimal S2.** S2 contains only fields necessary for Eligibility/Acceptance/selection; any extra derived traits remain provenance.
1. **TaskSignature present (S2).** All TaskKinds **publish** a TaskSignature with all fields declared and **CHR‑typed**; `unknown` supported for each.
2. **CHR legality proven.** Any numeric comparison/aggregation **cites CG‑Spec** by **Characteristic id** and proves **CSLC legality**; **no mean on ordinals; no unit mixing**.
3. **Unknowns propagate.** Unknowns **must** map to {pass|degrade|abstain} in **Acceptance**/**Eligibility**; no implicit coercions; behavior recorded in **SCR**.
4. **Evidence lanes.** **A.10 anchors** + **Assurance lanes (TA/VA/LA)** + **freshness windows** recorded; **Γ‑fold** default=weakest‑link unless proved otherwise.
5. **ReferencePlane guarded.**  ReferencePlane noted **per value and per ObjectiveProfile head**; on crossings apply **CL** (and **CL^plane** if planes differ); **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane** are **monotone, bounded, table‑backed and documented in the `CG‑Spec`**; penalties → **R_eff only** (F/G invariant).
6. **Acceptance thresholds live in CAL.** No thresholds in CHR or code paths; only in **G.4 AcceptanceClauses**. 
7. **Selector legality.** Selection uses **admissible (possibly partial) orders**; **weighted sums across mixed scale types are forbidden**; return a **Pareto set** when appropriate. 
8. **ATS crossings published.** Any AT0↔AT1↔AT2 reuse emits **BridgeDescription + UTS row** with CL notes and planes. 
9. **UTS twin labels.** All exported cards publish **Name Cards** with twin labels; Bridges carry loss notes. 
10. **ATS harness.** **AH‑1..AH‑4** (E.11) checks pass for: TierClassifier, GateCheck, LaneCheck, LexicalCheck on the published TaskSignature and crossings.
11. **QD fields (when QD is in scope).** If `PortfolioMode=Archive` or QD heads are present, **CharacteristicSpaceRef** (d≥2), **ArchiveConfig** (topology, resolution, K, `InsertionPolicyRef`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`), and **EmitterPolicyRef** **SHALL** be present and CHR‑typed; characteristics declare **ReferencePlane**.
12. **DominanceRegime default.** `DominanceRegime` **defaults to `ParetoOnly`**; inclusion of illumination in dominance **MUST** be enabled by a **CAL.Acceptance policy**; the policy id **SHALL** be published in SCR.
13. **Telemetry.** **PathSliceId**, **refresh/decay policies**, and **edition counters** for **CharacteristicSpaceRef**/**DistanceDefRef**/**EmitterPolicyRef** **SHALL** be recorded; any illumination increase **SHALL** log the **policy‑id** that triggered it.
14. **GeneratorIntent (when OEE is in scope).** `GeneratorIntent` **SHALL** cite **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`** and **`TransferRulesRef`** (ids resolvable in G.5/C.23); absence ⇒ `Abstain` for OEE dispatch.
15. **Budgets.** `Budgeting` (eval/time/batch) **SHALL** declare units and E/E‑LOG exploration budget id when used.
16. **Archive legality.** `DistanceDefRef.edition` and any novelty measures **SHALL** be CSLC‑lawful and **editioned**; illegal ops ⇒ **Abstain**.
17. **Planes.** **ReferencePlane** **SHALL** be declared for all QD heads/axes; plane crossings apply **Φ\_plane** (penalty to **R** only).
18. **Unknowns.** Unknown QD fields **map** to `{degrade|abstain|sandbox}`; no coercions.

### 10) Interfaces & Data Paths

+*Inputs.* `ProblemProfile` (…Description), CG‑Spec ids, Evidence Graph Ref (A.10), D.CTX; (if QD) CharacteristicSpaceRef/ArchiveConfig/EmitterPolicyRef configs; (if OEE) GeneratorIntent.
 *Produces.* `TaskSignature@Context` (S2) with provenance; **SCR‑visible** fields; UTS Name Cards for any minted traits; (if QD/OEE) archive/portfolio semantics and telemetry hooks declared.
 *Consumed by.* **G.5** (Eligibility/Selection kernel), **G.4** (Acceptance/Evidence), **C.23** (admit/degrade/abstain rules; maturity ladder).

### 11) Consequences (informative)

* **Lawful selection.** Dispatch is **explainable** and **audit‑ready**; every reason in/out cites TaskSignature fields, CG‑Spec rows, and Γ‑fold contributors. 
* **Local first, portable later.** Context‑local semantics are primary; Bridges make portability **deliberate and costed** (penalties to **R** only). 
* **Frictionless downstream.** G.1–G.5 consume a **single, typed** Standard; thresholds are cleanly separated into **Acceptance**; unknowns are not guessed.
* **QD/OEE‑ready.** Typed QD and GeneratorIntent fields make **portfolio** and **open‑ended** workflows **first‑class**, with lawful dominance, editioned distances, and policy‑aware illumination.

### 12) Relations

**Builds on:** **C.16 MM‑CHR**, **G.0 CG‑Spec**. **Coordinates with:** **G.4 Acceptance**, **G.5 Selector**, **C.18 NQD‑CAL**, **C.19 E/E‑LOG**, **C.23 Method‑SoS‑LOG**. **Constrained by:** **E.10 (LEX/I/D/S)**, **E.11 (ATS)**.

### 13) Author’s quick checklist

1. **Write the ProblemProfile.** Context, TaskKind, ObjectKinds, USM **ScopeSlice(G)**, describedEntity (GroundingHolon, ReferencePlane). 
2. **Fill TaskSignature (S2).** Populate all fields; mark `unknown` explicitly; align **Missingness** with CHR semantics. 
3. **Bind CG‑Spec ids.** For any numeric comparison/aggregation you expect downstream, cite **CG‑Spec.Characteristics** and prove **CSLC** legality. 
4. **Attach Evidence Graph Ref.** Lanes (TA/VA/LA), carriers, freshness windows; set **Γ‑fold** default; no self‑evidence. 
5. **Publish crossings.** If importing from other tiers/Contexts, mint **BridgeDescription + UTS row**; record **CL/CL^plane**; penalties **→ R only**. 
6. **Keep thresholds in Acceptance.** Move any thresholds (gate numbers) into **G.4**;  wire **RSCR** refusal tests (illegal ops; unit/scale checks; **tri‑state unknowns**; CL→R routing; **Φ tables present**).
7. **Run AH‑1..AH‑4** (ATS harness) on the signature and crossings; attach **UTS Name Cards** with twin labels.
8. **Bias audit.** Check E.5.4 and C.21 hooks if the problem lives *inside* a discipline dashboard or SoTA pack.

### 14) Goldilocks hook (design‑time)

When generating candidate solutions for a **TaskKind**, target **“goldilocks”** slots (feasible‑but‑hard) so that the TaskSignature is informative (neither trivial nor impossible); this aligns with **G.1** (target goldilocks, abductive provenance) and ensures the **TaskSignature is informative** (neither trivial nor impossible) for **G.5** selection.

## C.23 — **Method‑SoS‑LOG — MethodFamily Evidence & Maturity**  \[A]

*Architheory: LOG (deductive shells for admissibility)*
*First use expansion:* **SoS‑LOG = Science‑of‑Science LOG** (LEX short‑form discipline applied).

**HomeContext.** For this pattern, *HomeContext* means the `U.BoundedContext` where a `MethodFamily` is registered (LEX D.CTX).

**Builds on.** **G.5** (MethodFamily registry/selector), **G.4** (Acceptance & EvidenceProfiles), **C.22** (TaskSignature S2), **C.18 NQD‑CAL** (QD/illumination), **C.19 E/E‑LOG** (emitters/policies), **B.3** (Assurance lanes & `R_eff`), **A.10** (Evidence Graph Ref), **E.10** (LEX), **E.11** (ATS). **Coordinates with.** **G.6** (EvidenceGraph), **G.8** (LOG bundling), **G.9** (Parity), **G.11** (Refresh).     

### 1) Problem frame

Families of methods compete inside a CG‑Frame. The selector (G.5) must **admit, degrade, or abstain** per family **without** universal scores, using **typed** problem descriptors and **auditable** evidence. Maturity of a family (how far it has travelled from “clever idea” to “run‑safe”) must be **visible to LOG** rules yet **separate from thresholds** (which live only in **AcceptanceClauses**, G.4). 

### 2) Problem

Unstructured “readiness” stories and undisciplined evidence lead to:

* (i) **Illicit scalarisation** across mixed scale types,
* (ii) **Prose‑only** gating that a dispatcher cannot execute,
* (iii) Cross‑Context reuse without Bridges/CL, and
* (iv) Immature families leaking into production.
  We need a **notation‑independent LOG layer** that turns **TaskSignature (S2)** + **EvidenceProfiles** into **executable rules** for *admit / degrade / abstain*, **routing any CL penalties to `R_eff` only** (never mutating **F/G**). 

### 3) Forces

* **Pluralism vs. dispatchability.** Competing Traditions expose different invariants; selection must compare **without semantic flattening**.
* **Maturity vs. opportunity.** Open‑ended exploration (E/E‑LOG) must coexist with **run‑safe** exploitation; *immature ≠ forbidden* → provide safe **degrade** paths.
* **Unknowns (tri‑state).** Missing or `unknown` S2 fields must propagate **explicitly** to *degrade/abstain/sandbox*; no silent coercions.
* **Lexical discipline.** Head‑anchoring, I/D/S separation, Bridge hygiene; **no tool names in Core**.

---

### 4) Solution — **Method‑SoS‑LOG**: deductive shells over Eligibility & Evidence

#### 4.1 Objects & heads (LEX/I‑D‑S)

*Tech heads; Plain twins are published via UTS.*
**`MethodFamily`** (registered in G.5) carries **Eligibility** and artefact identity; **`MaturityCard`** (this pattern) carries evidence‑aware maturity; **`SoS‑LOG.Rule`** (this pattern) is an executable rule schema that returns one of `{Admit | Degrade(mode) | Abstain}` for a `(TaskSignature, MethodFamily)` pair. Descriptions live as `…Description`; when harnessed they become `…Spec`. 

#### 4.2 Rule schema (normative)

For each `MethodFamily` **f**, author an **executable** rule set:

```
LOG.Deduce_f(TaskSignature S2) → {Admit | Degrade(mode) | Abstain}
```

with the following **branch obligations**:

**R0 — CG‑Spec gate (precondition, HomeContext).** Before R1–R3, verify **CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence** for every CHR characteristic referenced by *f*’s Acceptance/Flows **in the home Context**; failure ⇒ `Abstain` with reasons (no silent sandbox). Publish the **CG‑Spec ids** consulted. 
*Rationale:* selector legality requires the CG‑Spec gate to be explicit, not implicit in prose. Publish associated **ReferencePlane** notes alongside the consulted ids.

**R0.QD — QD/OEE pre‑gates (if applicable).** If S2 declares **BehaviorSpaceRef/ArchiveConfig/EmitterPolicyRef** or `PortfolioMode=Archive`, verify:
(i) **CharacteristicSpaceRef** characteristics are CHR‑typed, d≥2, **ReferencePlane** per characteristic declared;
(ii) **ArchiveConfig** is lawful (topology, resolution, **K**>0, `InsertionPolicyRef`, `DistanceDef` with **edition id** and declared metric/pseudometric status);
(iii) **EmitterPolicyRef** present (with **edition id**);
 (iv) **DominanceRegime** present; if absent, **default= ParetoOnly**.
 Failure of any ⇒ `Abstain` with reasons.

**R1 — Admit.** `Admit` **IFF**
(a) S2 satisfies **Eligibility** predicates of *f* (tri‑state aware),
(b) **EvidenceProfile minima** referenced by Acceptance/Flows for *f* are met (lanes/anchors/freshness) **in the home Context** (post R0),
(c) all relevant **CAL.AcceptanceClauses** (G.4) evaluate to true under lawful CHR comparisons,
(d) any **maturity gating** (e.g., a floor on Maturity rungs) is expressed as an **AcceptanceClause** and referenced here by id (no thresholds inside LOG).
*LOG never sets thresholds; it only executes and cites Acceptance verdicts.*

**R2 — Degrade.** If (a) holds but (b) or (c) is **partially** satisfied or **unknown**, return `Degrade(mode)` where `mode ∈ {scope‑narrow | sandbox | probe‑only}` and **emit scope notes** (USM Scope(G), Γ_time). Record which S2 unknowns or Evidence minima caused the degrade. **LOG‑Degrade** never changes **CHR scales or planes**; it **narrows Scope (G)** or **execution mode**. 
**Note (CAL vs LOG).** CAL‑level **`degrade.order`** (fall‑back to order‑only comparisons) is governed by **G.4**/**CG‑Spec** and is **not** a LOG mode. **SoS‑LOG never overrides CAL outcomes**; a LOG branch **only narrows** `Scope(G)` or **execution mode** (e.g., `sandbox`, `probe‑only`), it **does not** alter CHR scales or admissible orders.
`probe‑only` MUST cite an **E/E‑LOG policy id** (exploration budget) and Acceptance‑bound guards.

**R3 — Abstain.** If S2 violates **Eligibility** *or* **R0** fails, return `Abstain` (with reasons). **Abstain** is mandatory on **illegal CHR operations** (e.g., ordinal means) and when **Bridge/CL** requirements are unmet. 

**R4 — CL routing.** Any cross‑Context/plane reuse must cite **Bridge ids** (with loss notes). Apply **Φ(CL)** and (if planes differ) **Φ_plane** that are **monotone, bounded, table‑backed**; **publish policy‑ids** in the SCR; **penalties reduce `R_eff` only**; **F/G must remain invariant**.

**R5 — Proof hooks.** Every branch **MUST** cite **Evidence Graph Ref** (A.10), lane tags (TA/VA/LA), freshness windows, and (if bridged) **Bridge ids + loss notes**; the decision is **SCR‑visible**. When **G.6 EvidenceGraph** is present, also **publish EvidenceGraph path id(s)** for the branch (admit/degrade/abstain). **No self‑evidence**.

**R6 — QD portfolio semantics (if applicable).** If `PortfolioMode=Archive`, `Admit` may return a **QD archive** (per `ArchiveConfig`) instead of only a Pareto set. Unless **CAL** authorises `DominanceRegime=ParetoPlusIllumination`, **illumination/coverage** act as **gauges** (reported in telemetry) and **do not** affect dominance.

**R7 — GeneratorFamily branches (open‑ended).** If S2 includes `GeneratorIntent`, SoS‑LOG **MUST**:
 (i) verify **`EnvironmentValidityRegion`** is declared and lawful;
 (ii) verify **`TransferRulesRef`** exists; if `unknown` ⇒ `Degrade(scope‑narrow)` or `Abstain` per family policy;
 (iii) treat the selection surface as **pairs `{environment, method}`**; publish **coverage/regret** and **IlluminationSummary** as gauges (dominance participation per **R6**).

**R8 — Telemetry & Refresh hooks.** On any illumination increase or archive change, publish **edition increments** for **CharacteristicSpaceRef**/**DistanceDefRef** and the **policy‑id** (Emitter/Acceptance) that caused the change; expose **PathSliceId** for refresh/decay in SCR.

> *Aphorism.* **“Admit on lawfulness and sufficiency; degrade on uncertainty; abstain on illegality.”**

#### 4.3 Maturity ladder (poset, not a scalar; Description, not Spec)

Publish a **`MethodFamily.MaturityCardDescription@Context`** (UTS enum ids; **Scale kind = ordinal**; **ReferencePlane declared**). Do **not** embed thresholds here; any **maturity floors** used for admission are authored as **G.4 AcceptanceClause** and referenced by id from R1.

* **L0 — Anecdotal.** Claims exist; lanes sparse; examples ad‑hoc.
* **L1 — Worked‑Examples.** Multiple **worked examples** with lane tags and **Scope slices** declared; *no replication yet*.
* **L2 — Replicated.** Independent replication(s) in distinct Context slices (publish D.CTX + UTS rows), lane separation observed, decay windows explicit.
* **L3 — Benchmark‑Severe.** Repeated wins or parity on **community baselines** or **severe tests**; cross‑Tradition bridges declared with **loss notes**.

*Optional rung (for QD/OEE‑heavy families; ordinal, closed enum):*
* **L4 — QD‑Hardened.** Archive stability under declared **InsertionPolicy/DistanceDef** editions; reproducible **IlluminationSummary** improvements under controlled budgets; OEE generators pass **EnvironmentValidityRegion** severe tests.

**Norms.**
**M1.** The ladder is **lane‑aware** (TA/VA/LA) and **freshness‑aware**; it is **not** a global numeric score. Declare **Scale kind=ordinal** and the **closed enumeration** of rungs; register the enum at **UTS** (twin labels; editioned).
**M2.** Transitions **MUST** be justified by **EvidenceGraph** paths (once G.6 is available) and UTS publication; missing anchors ⇒ no advance.
**M3.** Any **maturity floor** used for admission (e.g., “run‑critical Context requires ≥L2”) **MUST** be authored as a **CAL.AcceptanceClause** and referenced by id from R1; SoS‑LOG does **not** embed thresholds.
**M4.** Declare **ReferencePlane** for the MaturityCard; on ReferencePlane crossings apply published **Φ_plane** policy (penalty to **R_eff only**), with Bridge id and loss notes.

> *Rationale note.* Treating maturity as a **poset** aligns with B.3’s lane calculus and avoids **scalarisation across ordinal/ratio** scales; assurance penalties remain on **R**, never **F/G**.

#### 4.4 Unknowns & Shift classes (tri‑state discipline)

**U1. (LEX/ATS).** Enumerations for `Degrade(mode)` and Maturity rungs **MUST** be declared as **closed value sets** and **registered at UTS** (twin labels). AH‑4 (LexicalCheck) **applies**.
**U2.** Every S2 field is tri‑state; `unknown` **MUST** map to a branch (`Degrade` or `Abstain`) declared on the **family** (no coercions). Each branch publishes a **branch‑id** and (where used) a `mode` from a **closed enum** registered at **UTS** (LEX enum clarity).
**U3.** `ShiftClass` semantics follow **C.22**. If `ShiftClass ∈ {covariate‑shift, concept‑drift, adversarial}` or `unknown`, default outcome is `Degrade(scope‑narrow)` unless a CAL.AcceptanceClause explicitly guards the regime.

#### 4.5 Publication & wiring

**W1.** Each family publishes a **`MaturityCardDescription@Context`** (UTS twin labels; ReferencePlane declared) and **registers SoS‑LOG rule ids**; editions are versioned and **RSCR‑tested for branch‑coverage** (Admit/Degrade/Abstain, unknown paths). **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane policy‑ids** must be present in SCR where applicable.
**W2. Admissibility Ledger.** Publish an **`AdmissibilityLedger@Context`**: rows = `(MethodFamilyId, RuleId, MaturityRung, BranchIds, BridgeIds, ΦPolicyIds, EvidenceGraphPathIds?, DominanceRegime, PortfolioMode, Edition)`, UTS‑registered; this ledger is the **selector‑facing** export.
**W3. Strategy token.** Do **not** mint a `U.Type` “Strategy”; strategy remains a **composition** inside G.5 (`Compose`) under **E/E‑LOG**.
**W4.** Selector (G.5) **consumes** these rules; results appear in the **Dispatcher Report** with reasons in/out and cited anchors/bridges.

### 5) Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

*(Plain register for pedagogy; Core remains notation‑independent per E.10/E.8.)*

**Show‑1 · Continuous dynamics (ODE task).**
*S2 excerpt.* `DataShape=ODE; stiff?=unknown; Size≈10^3; Objective={↓error@ratio, ↑throughput@ratio}; Constraints={safety_gate@ordinal}; Jacobian_sparsity=high; Missingness=MAR`.
*Families.* `Implicit‑BDF` vs `Explicit‑RK` vs `Symplectic`.
*Rules.*
— `Implicit‑BDF`: **Eligibility** tolerates `stiff?=unknown` if `Jacobian_sparsity=high` (guarded precondition); **MaturityCard**=`L3` (replicated & benchmarked). Outcome: `Admit`.
— `Explicit‑RK`: requires `stiff?=false`; with `unknown` ⇒ `Degrade(sandbox)` (probe).
— `Symplectic`: eligible only when `Hamiltonian=true`; here ⇒ `Abstain`.
*Didactic anchor.* This mirrors C.22’s typed‑signature discipline and CHR legality (no ordinal means; unit alignment for **ratio**).

> Contemporary ecosystem examples of these families (post‑2015) are organised in **DifferentialEquations.jl**, which exposes multiple solver **families** under one call surface—precisely the pattern G.5 expects. ([Journal of Open Research Software][1])

**Show‑2 · Planning/scheduling (MIP task).**
*S2 excerpt.* `DataShape=MIP; NoiseModel=deterministic; Objective={↓cost@ratio, ↑service_level@ordinal}; Size≈10^5 vars; convex_relaxation=available`.
*Families.* `MILP (branch‑and‑bound)`, `Constraint‑Programming`, `Heuristic meta‑search`.
*Rules.*
— `MILP`: **Eligibility** requires `convex_relaxation=available`; **MaturityCard**=`L3` in the home Context ⇒ `Admit`.
— `Constraint‑Programming`: **MaturityCard**=`L2`; Acceptance demands `service_level≥B` (ordinal predicate). With `B` met but baseline parity unknown ⇒ `Degrade(scope‑narrow)`.
— `Heuristic meta‑search`: **MaturityCard**=`L1` ⇒ `Degrade(sandbox)` or `Abstain` depending on RSCR parity policy.
*Didactic anchor.* Selector returns a **Pareto set** (no cross‑ordinal weighting), as required by G.5.

> Contemporary “single call / many solvers” packaging that motivates MethodFamily rows is exemplified by **JuMP** (2017–2022), which cleanly separates **model description** from solver choice. ([Miles Lubin][2])

— *DifferentialEquations.jl* illustrates **family‑based** solver packaging (multi‑method under one interface), 2017–2024 ecosystem. ([Journal of Open Research Software][1])
— *JuMP* illustrates **model/solver separation** and registry‑like selection (2021–2022 papers, site). ([Miles Lubin][2])
— *Science of Science* review (2018) supports the emphasis on replication/benchmarks in maturity assessment. ([Science][3])

**Show‑3 · QD archive (policy search).**
*S2 excerpt.* `PortfolioMode=Archive; CharacteristicSpaceRef(d=2); ArchiveConfig(CVT, res=1k cells, K=1, DistanceDefRef.edition=v2, InsertionPolicyRef=dyn‑elite); EmitterPolicyRef=v3; DominanceRegime=ParetoOnly`.
*Rules.* `Admit` returns an **archive**; illumination **reported**; changes to `DistanceDef`/Emitter **editioned** in SCR; dominance remains **ParetoOnly**.

**Show‑4 · Open‑ended GeneratorFamily (POET‑class).**
*S2 excerpt.* `GeneratorIntent{GeneratorFamilyRef=GF‑01, EnvironmentValidityRegion=EVR‑A, TransferRulesRef=TR‑A, CoverageMetric=…}; PortfolioMode=Archive`.
*Rules.* `Admit` yields portfolios over `{environment, method}`; `Degrade(scope‑narrow)` if `TransferRules`=`unknown`; telemetry publishes **coverage/regret** and **IlluminationSummary** with **edition/policy‑id** on improvements.

### 6) Bias‑Annotation

**Principle‑taxonomy lenses.** *Universality* (trans‑discipline), *Didactic primacy* (Tell–Show–Show), *Open‑ended evolution* (refresh‑ready), *Lexical firewall* (no tool names in Core), *Notation independence*. Limits: Worked examples reference widely‑used ecosystems **in Plain register** only.

### 8) Consequences

* **Explainable admission.** Every *Admit/Degrade/Abstain* is backed by **anchored** evidence and explicit unknown handling (selector reports are SCR‑linked).
* **Run‑safe pluralism.** Multiple families can co‑exist with **policy‑governed** exploration (E/E‑LOG) and maturity‑aware gating.
* **Portable governance.** Bridge hygiene and CL routing make cross‑Tradition reuse **deliberate and costed** (penalties to **R** only).

### 9) Rationale

The ladder and LOG shells align with FPF’s **Assurance calculus**: **F** (form) is governed by artefact kind, **G** (scope) by USM slices, and **R** (reliability) accumulates via WLNK then **Φ(CL)** penalties. Treating maturity as **evidence‑typed rungs**—rather than a “score”—avoids illegal arithmetic and lets **design/run** remain separate per ATS. This mirrors contemporary **science‑of‑science** insights: replication, benchmarking, and field health indicators are the **currency** of maturity, not anecdote.  ([Science][3])

### 10) Relations

**Builds on:** **G.5** (selector consumes these rules), **G.4** (Acceptance & EvidenceProfiles), **C.22** (S2 typing), **C.18 NQD‑CAL**, **C.19 E/E‑LOG**, **B.3** (Assurance tuple & WLNK).   
**Publishes to:** **UTS** (MaturityCards, rule ids), **SCR/RSCR** (branch coverage; parity hooks).
**Constrains:** **G.8** (LOG Bundling must cite MaturityCards), **G.9** (parity harness draws baselines per rung), **G.11** (refresh windows per rung & decay), **G.5** (Open‑Ended Family mode for GeneratorFamily).
**Outcome.** The pattern introduces **new content** (LOG shells + maturity poset + degrade modes + publication Standard) and **does not duplicate** CG‑Spec legality rules, CHR guard‑macros, or CAL acceptance mechanics; it *integrates* them into **admissibility logic** for MethodFamilies.

## C.24 — Agentic Tool‑Use & Call‑Planning (C.Agent‑Tools‑CAL)  \[A]

**Status.** Architheory specification (**CAL**). Defines the conceptual calculus for **agentic selection and sequencing of tool calls** under budgets, trust gates, and policy. **ΔKernel = 0** (no kernel primitives added). *Minting note:* this CAL **does not mint** new U‑types; it **aliases** canonical U‑types where appropriate via **E.10/UTS**.

**Instantiates / Refines Pillars.** E.2 P‑3 Scalable Formality, P‑7 Pragmatic Utility, P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution, P‑11 SoTA Alignment, and the **Bitter‑Lesson Preference** (prefer scalable, general methods that benefit from more data/compute over fragile hand‑tuned heuristics when assurance/cost are comparable).

**Depends on.** A‑kernel (A.1–A.15) for holonic basics and **Role–Method–Work** separation; **B.3** Trust & Assurance (F–G–R with CL penalties); **E.3/E.5** (precedence & Guard‑Rails); **C.5** Resrc‑CAL; **C.18** NQD‑CAL (candidate generation/portfolio); **C.19** E/E‑LOG (explore–exploit policies); **optional** Compose‑CAL and KD‑CAL (knowledge dynamics) where available.

**Coordinates with.**
U.WorkPlan and U.Service bindings (acceptance gates), Working‑Model publication discipline (**per B.3**), Evidence/Provenance (G.6).

### 1) Problem frame

Modern systems increasingly rely on **agents** that can **choose tools** (services/methods) and **plan sequences** of calls to achieve objectives in uncertain contexts. Without a calculus:

* calls are scheduled by **ad‑hoc heuristics**,
* **budgets** (compute, cost, wall‑time) are implicit,
* **assurance** and **policy provenance** are lost, and
* agents either over‑constrain themselves with brittle scripts or wander without guard‑rails.

This CAL provides the **conceptual API for thought** that lets any implementation (LLM‑based, search‑based, code‑based, robotic) plan calls **lawfully**, **audibly**, and **scalably**. (Role–Method–Work alignment; didactic primacy.)  

### 2) Problem

We need a **tool‑agnostic** way to (i) identify **admissible tools**, (ii) **score** candidate call sequences, (iii) allocate an **explore/exploit** share, (iv) enforce **budget & harm** gates, and (v) **replan** on signals—**without** baking domain‑specific heuristics into the core and **without** violating B.3 assurance discipline. 

### 3) Forces

| Force                              | Tension                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **General methods vs. hand‑craft** | Scalable, model‑centric search ↔ short‑term wins of bespoke scripts (guarded by **Bitter‑Lesson Preference**). |
| **Assurance vs. Autonomy**         | F‑G‑R gates & CL penalties ↔ agent freedom to sequence calls and learn online.                                 |
| **Exploration vs. Delivery**       | Exploration share for illumination ↔ delivery SLAs and cost ceilings (E/E‑LOG policy).                         |
| **Separation of concerns**         | Planning (MethodDescription) ↔ execution (Work) ↔ service promises (U.Service).                                |

### 4) Solution — Signature & Realization

**Types (aliases).**
*`ATC.CallSpec`* ≡ `U.MethodDescription` with `accessSpec` for a tool service;
*`ATC.CallPlan`* ≡ `U.WorkPlan` specialised for tool invocations;
*`ATC.CallGraph`* ≡ Evidence/Provenance graph over a `U.Work` ledger;
*`ATC.Policy`* references `U.EmitterPolicyRef` (E/E‑LOG) and local call gates **including BLP tolerances (α, δ)**.

**Roles.**
A **System in AgentialRole** composes a **Plan** (MethodDescription); upon enactment, a **Performer** executes **Work** (calls), and **Observers** record **Observations** with acceptance checks. (A.15 strict distinction.) 

**Operators (Γ_agent; CAL, conceptual):**

1. `Γ_agent.eligible(tool, TaskSignature, K_ctx) → {true|false, notes}`
   *Eligibility gate* based on capability fit, policy allow‑list/deny‑list, and context K (incl. safety constraints).

2. `Γ_agent.enumerate(TaskSignature, K_ctx) → CandidateSet<ATC.CallSpec>`
   Returns admissible calls. **MAY** delegate to **NQD‑CAL** for portfolio enumeration when families are heterogeneous and **MUST** apply the current **E/E‑LOG lens** (objectives & gauges) to tag candidates.

3. `Γ_agent.plan(Objective, CandidateSet, Budget, ATC.Policy) → ATC.CallPlan`
   Produces a **call plan** with steps `{pre, call, post}`, *explicit budgets* (compute, cost, time, risk), and **E/E policy** (explore_share, tie‑breakers, stop‑conditions). The plan is a MethodDescription, not Work.  

4. `Γ_agent.execute(ATC.CallPlan) → {ATC.CallGraph, Observations}`
   Executes with **hard gates** (budget, risk, constraint‑fit) and logs provenance suitable for B.3 assurance reporting (design/run separated). 

5. `Γ_agent.replan(Signals, ATC.CallPlan, Budget′) → ATC.CallPlan′`
   Triggered by sentinel breaches, assurance drops, or policy events; preserves **editioned** policy and context. (Design/run separation; Working‑Model handshake.) 

6. `Γ_agent.score(Plan or Step) → ⟨ValueProxies, Cost, Risk, FGR_floor⟩`
   Computes selection signals **without** illegal scalarisation across mixed scales; **uses Pareto comparison under the C.19 E/E‑LOG lens** and defers final dominance to declared policies. 

**Normative Laws (ATC‑Laws).**

* **ATC‑1 (Model‑the‑Call, not the App).** A tool call is a **Work** instance that enacts a referenced **MethodDescription** promised by a **Service**; plans schedule calls but are **not the calls**. (A.15.)
* **ATC‑2 (Bitter‑Lesson Preference).** When two admissible choices are within **δ (assurance)** and **α (budget)**, **prefer the more general, scale‑benefiting method** whose **slope vector Pareto‑dominates** under the declared E/E‑LOG objectives; any override **MUST** record a **BLP‑waiver** with expiry. (E.2; precedence governed by E.3.)
* **ATC‑3 (Budget & Harm Gates).** Plans **SHALL** declare ceilings on compute, cost, wall‑time, and risk; execution **MUST** abort or replan on breach. (Assurance ties to B.3; design/run kept separate.)
* **ATC‑4 (Explore‑Share Discipline).** Plans **MUST** declare `explore_share`; defaults **inherit from E/E‑LOG profiles**. **Informative defaults**: `0` for safety‑critical or deterministic tasks; `≈0.2–0.4` for ambiguous tasks with heterogeneous tool families. Promotion of illumination gauges into dominance **requires explicit policy**.
* **ATC‑5 (Provenance & Replay).** Every call **MUST** emit a **CallGraph** with: Service id, MethodDescription edition, inputs/outputs (redacted per privacy), **EmitterPolicyRef**, and budget deltas. (NQD/E/E provenance fields apply when used.)
* **ATC‑6 (Assurance‑First Decisions).** Selection **MUST** respect B.3: WLNK minima on F/R (weakest‑link floors), CL penalties on integration, and **no** chimera scores across design/run. Publish **⟨F,G,R⟩** for the *typed claim* “this plan is admissible under K,S”.
* **ATC‑7 (Notation/Vendor Independence).** Core pattern text **MUST NOT** encode vendor‑specific tokens; bindings occur in Context via Bridges/Profiles. (Lexical guard‑rails.)


### 5) Policy Block (normative, profile‑able)

**ATC‑Policy fields (conceptual):**
`{ backstop_confidence, explore_share, risk_bound, cost_ceiling, time_ceiling, tie_breakers, novelty_quota?, wild_bet_quota?, stop_conditions, BLP_delta_α, BLP_delta_δ }` — realized by referencing an **E/E‑LOG EmitterPolicy** and adding **BLP** clauses. Defaults inherit from E/E‑LOG; any deviation is editioned.

**BLP Precedence.** In conflicts with tactics that hard‑code narrow scripts, **BLP** applies **subject to E.3/E.5 precedence**. Where scripts encode **safety‑critical gating or regulatory compliance**, scripts **prevail** unless a DRR records: (i) **override rationale**, (ii) **expiry**, (iii) **measured hazard** avoided, and (iv) planned **re‑evaluation** window (P‑10 evolution duty).

### 6) Archetypal Grounding (informative; non‑binding)

1. **LLM Research Agent (knowledge work).**
   Task: answer a novel technical question. Candidate tools: retrieval, structured web search, code runner, table/plot generator.
   **Plan:** `enumerate → plan(explore_share≈0.4) → call(search→retrieve→synthesise→code‑check) → replan on sentinel (low R)`; **BLP** favours **general retrieval + prompting policies** over hand‑coded, per‑site scrapers unless assurance demands otherwise. (Echoes SoTA: *ReAct* (2022), *Self‑Ask* (2022), *Reflexion* (2023), *Tree‑of‑Thoughts* (2023), *Toolformer* (2023).)

2. **Program Repair Agent (systems/software).**
   Task: propose a patch against a failing test suite. Candidate tools: repo introspection, static analyzer, unit runner.
   **Plan:** prefer **search‑and‑learn loops** with test‑guided feedback over fixed “if error X then patch Y” tables; exploration quota enforces trials across patch families before exploitation. (Aligns with post‑2019 automated program repair lines and *SWE‑bench*‑style agent loops.)

3. **Lab Automation Agent (physical).**
   Task: adjust a wet‑lab protocol under drift. Candidate tools: planner, pipetting controller, spectrometer, Bayesian optimizer.
   **Plan:** **BLP** drives toward **model‑based optimization** under budgeted sample counts; heuristics remain as **policy‑documented** fallbacks with expiry. (Resonates with quality‑diversity and BO practice since 2015, mirrored by NQD/E/E policies.) 

### 7) Conformance Checklist (CC‑AT)

1. **CC‑ATC‑1 — Declared separation.** Plan is a `MethodDescription`; execution is `Work`; acceptance is via `U.Service`. No schedule inside specs; schedules live in `U.WorkPlan`.
2. **CC‑ATC‑2 — Budgets on record.** `time/compute/cost/risk` ceilings exist **ex ante**; stop conditions listed.
3. **CC‑ATC‑3 — E/E policy.** `EmitterPolicyRef` (or equivalent) and `explore_share` are editioned and logged.
4. **CC‑ATC‑4 — Assurance tuple.** Publish the **typed claim** “Plan admissible under K,S” with **⟨F,G,R⟩** and CL penalties traceable in the **CallGraph** SCR. Design/run never merged.
5. **CC‑ATC‑5 — BLP waiver discipline.** Any heuristic override against a general method includes **expiry** and **re‑evaluation** date.
6. **CC‑ATC‑6 — Provenance minimum.** Record `{ServiceRef, MethodDesc.edition, EmitterPolicyRef, DescriptorMapRef? (if NQD), DistanceDefRef? (if NQD), TimeWindow, Seeds?, Dedup?}`.
7. **CC‑ATC‑7 — Notation independence.** No vendor tokens in conceptual text; bindings via Bridges/Profiles only.
8. **CC‑ATC‑8 — BLP tolerances declared.** **α/δ** tolerances are present in `ATC.Policy` or referenced via the active E/E‑LOG profile.

### 8) Consequences

*Positive.* Portable agent patterns; **auditable autonomy**; lawful exploration; faster hypothesis cycles via BLP; replayable call graphs; decision‑grade Working‑Model surfaces.
*Trade‑offs.* Requires explicit budgets/policies; BLP may defer quick wins from bespoke scripts; stronger logging discipline.

### 9) Rationale (post‑2015 SoTA alignment, informative)

* **Scaling‑first methods** (language‑model and representation‑learning scaling laws; subsequent data/compute‑balanced scaling) empirically support **BLP**: general, learnable mechanisms tend to dominate as budgets rise—hence **ATC‑2**.
* **Tool‑use agents** in the literature (*ReAct*, *Self‑Ask*, *Reflexion*, *Toolformer*, *Tree‑of‑Thoughts*, open‑ended *Voyager*‑style skill acquisition) all benefit from **explicit planning + feedback**, exactly what CC‑AT‑2/3/6 encode.
* **Quality‑Diversity & BO** practice motivates the **explore_share** default and the distinction between **dominance vs. illumination gauges** (kept separate unless policy promotes).  

### 10) Relations

* **Builds on:** A.15 Role–Method–Work alignment (planning vs execution vs service), B.3 Trust & Assurance (F–G–R/CL), C.5 Resrc‑CAL, C.18 NQD‑CAL (candidate/portfolio), C.19 E/E‑LOG (policies).    
* **Constrains:** Any `U.Service` used as a “tool” MUST expose acceptance conditions and observation hooks sufficient for B.3 reporting. 
* **Enables:** Human‑centric Working‑Model surfaces with policy/assurance disclosures (design/run separated). 

### 11) Bias‑Annotation

*Lexical firewall* and *notation independence* apply; no vendor tokens; mixed‑scale characteristics are never averaged; illumination remains a **gauge** unless a policy promotes it into dominance.

## C.25 — **Q‑Bundle: Authoring “‑ilities” as Structured Quality Bundles**  \[D]

**Status & placement.** Part C (measurement/comparability); **Definitional pattern \[D]** reusing Core patterns (**A.2.6 USM**; **A.6.1 Mechanism**; **C.16 MM‑CHR / A.18 CSLC**). Intended as a **lightweight authoring aid** for Contexts; it adds no new kernel types.  (A.6.1; A.2.6 § 6.2; C.16/A.18). 

### 1 · Problem frame
Provide a **minimal, uniform shape** for engineering “‑ilities” so authors either (a) declare a **single CHR characteristic** (when truly measurable on one scale), or (b) publish a **structured bundle** that keeps **measures** (CHR) distinct from **scope** (USM set) and **mechanism/status** slots. This prevents conflation of **set‑algebra** (scope) with **numeric measurement** (CHR) and keeps assurance math stable.  (A.2.6 § 6.2; C.16).

### 2 · Problem (recurring)
*‑ilities* are often treated as if they were **single metrics**, while in practice many are **composites** whose evaluation depends on (i) **declared context‑of‑use** (Scope), (ii) **one or more CHR measures** (SLIs/SLOs), and (iii) **supporting mechanisms/statuses**. Collapsing these into “one number” invites illegal arithmetic and breaks USM locality.  (A.2.6; C.16).

### 3 · Forces
**Locality vs comparability.** Scope must remain **context‑local** (USM) while measures remain **legally comparable** (CSLC). 
**Mechanism vs measure.** Presence of a mechanism (A.6.1) is not itself a measurement, yet may gate admissibility and influence **R**.  (A.6.1; C.16/A.18).

### 4 · Solution — Q‑Bundle normal form (Tell → Show → Show; E.8 order)
**Definition.**  
`Q‑Bundle := ⟨ Name, Carrier, ClaimScope?, WorkScope?, Measures[CHR], QualificationWindow?, Mechanisms?, Status?, Evidence? ⟩`

**Fields (conceptual; reuse existing types).**
* **Name.** The quality family label (e.g., *Availability*, *Resilience*).  
* **Carrier.** `U.System | U.Service | U.Episteme` (what bears the quality).  
* **ClaimScope / WorkScope.** **USM** set(s) over `U.ContextSlice` (where the claim holds / where the capability can deliver). **Set‑valued; not CHR.**  (A.2.6 § 6.2).  
* **Measures[CHR].** One or more **CHR Characteristics bound to one Scale each** (e.g., `AvailabilityRatio[%]`, `RTO[min]`). **These are the measurable slots.** (C.16/A.18).  
* **QualificationWindow.** Time policy used by guards (point/window/rolling).  
* **Mechanisms / Status.** References to **A.6.1 U.Mechanism** realizations (e.g., redundancy policy, audit/trace) or certification/status flags. **Not measurements.** (A.6.1).  
* **Evidence (optional).** Anchors/stubs per A.10 or C.16 to justify measures/mechanisms.

**Conformance (minimal).**
1) If a publisher intends to use an “‑ility” as a **single measurement axis**, they **MUST** bind it to a **named `U.Characteristic` + CSLC Scale** and cite that axis in guards/UTS; otherwise publish a **Q‑Bundle**. (C.16/A.18).  
2) **Scope** remains **USM set‑valued**; guards use **membership/coverage** (“Scope covers TargetSlice”), never ordinal/averaging on G. (A.2.6 § 6.2).  
3) **Mechanisms/Status** MAY gate admissibility but **MUST NOT** be conflated with **Measures**; penalties from Bridges/planes route to **R** only. (A.6.1; Part B).

### 5 · Micro‑catalogue (worked mini‑sketches)
**Availability (often Q‑CHR).**  
*Scope:* observation window + region/tier (USM). *Measure:* `AvailabilityRatio[%]` (CHR). *Mechanisms:* redundancy/failover (A.6.1). **Guard:** Scope covers TargetSlice ∧ SLI/SLO satisfied.  

**Resilience (Q‑CMP).**  
*Scope:* disruption scenarios (USM). *Measures:* `MTTR`, `RTO`, `RPO` (CHR set). *Mechanisms:* drills/restore runbooks. **Guard:** scenario‑specific gates; **R** absorbs penalties from crossings.  

**Security (Q‑MECH/Q‑CMP).**  
*Scope:* trust zones/attack classes (USM). *Measures:* time‑to‑patch, coverage proportions (CHR). *Mechanisms/Status:* control sets, certs. **Guard:** policy/mechanism present ∧ measures thresholds ∧ Scope match.

### 6 · Relations
**Builds on.** **A.2.6** (USM scope algebra, set‑valued; no CSLC), **A.6.1** (mechanism intensions and guards), **C.16/A.18** (measurement legality: one Characteristic ↔ one Scale).  
**Coordinates with.** **B.3** (R/CL penalties only), **A.15** (Method–Work gates use Scope + Measures + Windows).

### 7 · Consequences (brief)
* **No category errors.** Authors cannot “average scope” or treat mechanisms as measurements.  
* **Portable comparisons.** Numbers compare on CHR Scales; scope composes by set algebra.  
* **Cleaner gates.** Admission checks become `Scope covers TargetSlice ∧ Measures met ∧ Window valid`.

### 8 · Quick authoring checklist (lintable)
* If the term is an **‑ility**, choose: **CHR axis** (bind to Characteristic+Scale) **or** **Q‑Bundle**.  
* Ensure any scope is **USM** (set over `U.ContextSlice`); no “G‑levels.”  
* Cite mechanisms/status separately; route crossings’ penalties to **R** only.
