## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual binding** that turns a *service promise* (SLO/SLA clause) into a **clear, local, time‑bounded judgement** about **actual Work**, using **Observations** as evidence and **explicit Bridges** where Cross‑context notions must meet. The result is a **Status** (Satisfied/Violated/Inconclusive) that attaches to the **clause‑about‑that‑Work‑in‑that‑Window**.

**Applicability.** Any situation where a service is promised (availability, latency, safety margin, response time, quality gate, compliance duty) and its fulfilment must be decided from what occurred. Works across digital services, industrial control, laboratory processes, clinical pathways, logistics, etc.
