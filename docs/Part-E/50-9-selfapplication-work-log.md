## 9) Self‑application Work Log (how this very pattern was authored)

> *This is **not** chain‑of‑thought; it is the required **`U.Work` evidence** for LEX‑AUTH.*

**Context.** `FPF/Core` (Canon); **Delta‑Class:** Δ‑2 (normative refinement by addition of method & CCs).
**Objectives.** Add an *evolutionary* authoring method; make trace *useful* (quality‑bearing); align with SoTA machinery already in spec.
**SoTA pack (evidence bound).** Prior FPF kernel commitments to **DRR (E.9)**, **E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE**, **B.4 Evolution**, **C.18/C.19** NQD/E‑E, **F.15** harness, **F.9** Bridges, **B.3** Trust; these are treated as the authoritative internal SoTA for the Canon here.
**NQD/E‑E.** Generated ≥3 alternative Solution sections; finalist chosen for clearer Δ‑classes and actionable LAT contents.
**Bridges.** No cross‑external mapping; intra‑canon references only (CL=3).
**Harness.** LEX‑BUNDLE lint (no tooling jargon), CCs unique/atomic, didactic “Tell‑Show‑Show” via Self‑application log, Universality criterion met by cross‑kernel applicability.
**Assurance Δ.** F: + (explicit method & CCs); G: + (scope separation & Δ‑classes); R: + (LAT obligations + bridge penalties).
**DRR.** Recorded: alternatives considered (lighter trace vs full LAT), chosen design (full LAT).
**Refresh.** Reopen when SoTA (e.g., G‑suite authoring kit or CHR templates) evolves or when LAT misuse is seen in reviews.
