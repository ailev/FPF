## 13 · Integration with A.15 — Role–Method–Work alignment

> **One line.** A `U.MethodDescription` **names** the roles it needs; a `U.Work` **cites** the concrete `U.RoleAssignment` that enacted the step; the **RSG state + window** gates that enactment.

### 13.1 Design‑time Standard (inside `U.MethodDescription`)

For every **MethodStep**:

* **`requiredRoles`** — a list of `U.Role` **from the same Context as the step**.
  *Example.* In `Hospital.OR_2025`, step “Make incision” has `requires: [IncisionOperatorRole]`.
* **Role algebra in‑Context** applies: if the Context defines `IncisionOperatorRole ≤ SurgeonRole`, then `requires: [SurgeonRole]` also admits holders of `IncisionOperatorRole`.
* **Separation of concerns.** Capability checks (does the holder *can*?) belong to `U.Capability` and resource limits; **authorization** belongs to `U.RoleAssignment` + RSG.

### 13.2 Run‑time check (inside `U.Work`)

A `U.Work` record must carry:

* **`performedBy` =** a concrete **`U.RoleAssignment`** (not just a person/system name).
* **Window gate.** The Work timestamp falls inside the assignment’s `@Window`.
* **State gate.** At that timestamp, an **enactable** state for the assignment is proven by a **`StateAssertion`** (the checklist verdict for a named RSG state).
* **Role algebra gate.** The assignment’s `role` is either one of `requiredRoles` or a **specialization (`≤`)** thereof; bundles (`⊗`) expand to conjunctions; incompatibilities (`⊥`) forbid overlaps on the same holder.

### 13.3 Evaluation & acceptance (link to services & deontics)

* **Observation.** The Work produces `U.Observation`(s).
* **Evaluation.** A `U.Evaluation` compares Observations with **AcceptanceClause**(s) referenced by a **Service** or a **RequirementRole**.
* **SoD hook.** If the step or evaluation demands independence (e.g., “not performed by its reviewer”), enforce via `⊥` between `PerformerRole` and `ReviewerRole` **in the same Context**.

### 13.4 Planning & scheduling (design‑time “who will enact”)

* **`U.WorkDescription`** (renamed from “WorkPlan”) binds forthcoming steps to **candidate RoleAssignments** and time windows.
* **Checks before the fact.** Validate windows (no gaps/overlaps where disallowed), enforce `⊥`, ensure expected RSG state will be **enactable** at scheduled time (or flag a pre‑flight checklist).

> **Didactic cue.** Think **“Step asks for badges; Run cites a badge; Badge must be valid & green.”**
> (Badge = RoleAssignment; valid = window; green = RSG state with a fresh StateAssertion.)
