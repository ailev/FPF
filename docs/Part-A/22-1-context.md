## 1 · Context (plain‑language motivation)

In real projects we must answer two different questions:

* **“Can this system do X?”** — this is about an **ability** inherent to the system.
* **“Is this system assigned to do X here and now?”** — this is about an **assignment** (a **Role assignment**) inside a bounded context.

+Teams frequently blur the two, and then further mix them with **how** the work is done (the **Method**) and **what actually happened** (the **Work**). `U.Capability` isolates **ability as a first‑class concept** so that you can plan realistically, staff responsibly, and audit cleanly.
