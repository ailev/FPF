## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Cluster by usage, not by string.**
Inside one context:

* **Same sense** → **Local‑Sense**: a small, coherent usage‑region the canon treats as one idea (even if it has aliases or minor surface variation).
* **Different sense** → **two Local‑Senses**: incompatible selectional frames, entailments, or role in the canon’s own statements.

Each Local‑Sense becomes **addressable** when paired with its Context: **SenseCell = (Context × Local‑Sense)**. SenseCells are **context‑local coordinates**; they do not pre‑judge any Cross‑context mapping.
