## 10 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern               | Symptom in texts                                                      | Why it harms thinking                                          | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Cross‑context rename**      | “Let’s rename *process (BPMN)* to *activity (PROV)*.”                 | Erases Context boundaries; hides loss; violates locality.         | **Do not rename across Contexts.** Keep both labels; if you must relate them, declare a **Bridge** (F.9) with CL/loss.              |
| **A2**  | **Retroactive rewrite**    | Old passages silently updated to new names.                           | Breaks provenance; misleads readers about what was meant then. | **Non‑retroactivity.** Past texts stand; add **read‑paths** via `renames/aliases`; attach **epoch notes** when helpful.          |
| **A3**  | **Alias flood**            | Long lists of synonyms for comfort.                                   | Raises ambiguity; dilutes teaching signals.                    | **Alias parsimony.** Keep ≤ 1 legacy alias per register (Tech/Plain) **inside the same Context or row**.                            |
| **A4**  | **Paint‑over rename**      | Rename used where sense actually changed.                             | Confuses continuity with revision; hides splits.               | Use **`splits`** (or **`merges`**), not `renames`. If Contexts diverge, adjust **rows** (F.7) and **Bridges** (F.9).                |
| **A5**  | **Global alias**           | One catchy word reused as alias in several Contexts.                     | Creates a pseudo‑global dictionary; invites category errors.   | **Local aliases only.** If a word appears in many Contexts, treat it as **homonymous**; keep Context‑prefixed speech.                  |
| **A6**  | **Euphemism treadmill**    | Frequent cosmetic renames (“modernising” labels) with no gain.        | Cognitive noise; readers lose confidence in names.             | Apply the **Same‑sense test**. If gain is marginal, **do nothing**; if clarity improves materially, one **`renames`** is enough. |
| **A7**  | **Grandfather everything** | Never deprecate confusing legacy labels.                              | Drags ambiguity forward; blocks sharper distinctions.          | When a label truly misleads and has no single successor, **`retires`** with a short **pointer note** to Contexts/rows.              |
| **A8**  | **Row drift via rename**   | Concept‑Set row is relabeled while its membership silently changes.   | Hides that the set changed; breaks Cross‑context alignment.       | First **split/merge rows** (F.7) as needed; only then `renames` the row **if** its intension stayed.                             |
| **A9**  | **Bridge‑by‑alias**        | Using an alias to hint two Contexts are “the same.”                      | Smuggles translation without CL/loss.                          | **No Cross‑context aliasing.** If similarity matters, **Bridge** explicitly (F.9) and keep labels separate.                         |
| **A10** | **Acronym absolutism**     | Treating acronyms as preferred labels everywhere (“SLO” in any Context). | Obscures Context‑specific senses; hurts didactics.                | Prefer **expanded** labels as preferred (F.5); keep acronym as context‑local **alias** only where historically dominant.            |
| **A11** | **Temporal fudge**         | Rename used to imply design↔run shift (“execution ≈ process”).        | Conflates time stances; erases important dualities.            | Keep **design/run** explicit on labels or glosses; if mapping is needed, do so in **F.9**.                                       |
| **A12** | **Over‑canonicalisation**  | Forcing a single “perfect” label across all rows/Contexts.               | Centralises language; breaks heterogeneity guard.              | Let each Context/row keep its **own preferred label**; put unification pressure only into **rows** and **Bridges**.                 |
