## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Treat names as lenses, not objects.**
The **thing that persists** is the *sense* (a **SenseCell** inside a Context, or the *Cross‑context alignment* embodied by a **Concept‑Set row**, or a **Role Description** that points to such sense). Names are **lenses** we look through. When the lens improves, we **record a continuity relation** between lenses; when the underlying sense changes, we **split/merge the thing**, then name accordingly.

> **Contexts keep names local.**
> A label (including aliases) always belongs to **one context** or to **one Concept‑Set row**. Cross‑context similarity is handled by **Bridges** (F.9), never by shared names.
