## 12 · Interaction with Service (external promise)

A **Service** is an **external promise**. It relies on capability but is not identical to it.

* **From capability to service.** You normally **derive** a Service by taking a capability and **fixing** the promise outward (e.g., “We guarantee close ≤ 5 days”).
* **From service back to capability.** If the promise raises the bar (e.g., tighter SLA), the underlying capability must meet or exceed it under the service’s context.
* **Staffing.** Delivering a Service still requires **Role assignments**; capability alone does not authorize action.

**Memory aid:** Capability = *can do*; Service = *promise to others that we will do*.
