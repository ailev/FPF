## 8 · Self‑checks (mental, not procedural)

* **Same‑sense test.** Can you point to the **same SenseCell** (or same row) before and after? If yes → `renames`/`aliases`. If no → `splits`/`merges`.
* **Context test.** Does the change stay **inside one context**? If it needs two Contexts to explain, it’s a **Bridge**, not a rename.
* **Reader test.** What two legacy strings would a newcomer actually meet in old texts? Keep **those two** as aliases; drop the rest.
* **History test.** Does your “continuity” require editing old claims? If yes, you’re attempting a **retroactive rewrite**—stop.
* **Didactic test.** Can you explain the continuity relation in **one sentence**? If not, you are hiding a sense change.
