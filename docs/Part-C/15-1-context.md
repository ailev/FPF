## 1 · Context

Transdisciplinary work (physics, software, systems, policy, data) needs a **shared notion of rigor** that travels across context of meaning. A controller invariant stated in a theorem prover, a research hypothesis framed in constrained English, and a managerial decision rule written as acceptance criteria must be **comparable**—not by their domain lore, but by **how strictly they are expressed**.

Historically, FPF texts carried **multiple signals of rigor** (narrative “modes,” editorial tiers, ad‑hoc “formal vs. informal” talk). These signals mixed with status labels (e.g., “Draft/Effective”), obscuring whether an “approved” artifact was **actually precise** or merely **organizationally accepted**. To reason soundly in KD‑CAL and to compose artifacts safely, we standardize a **single Formality characteristic F**:

* **Portable:** works for math, code, models, requirements, policies.
* **Ordinal & minimal:** few clear anchors from “sketch” to “foundations.”
* **Composable:** participates in the F–G–R calculus and weak‑link invariants.
* **Context‑extensible:** Contexts may introduce **intermediate anchors** without breaking comparability.
