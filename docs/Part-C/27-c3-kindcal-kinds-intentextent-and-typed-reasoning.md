# C.3 · **Kind‑CAL — Kinds, Intent/Extent, and Typed Reasoning**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** Establishes **`U.Kind`** as the **minimal, context‑local intensional carrier** of “what a statement is about,” separates **intent** (KindSignature + its own **F**) from **extent** (*which* instances belong to the kind **in a given Context slice**), and situates **typed reasoning** alongside **USM Scope (G)** and **F–G–R** without conflation. Details of the core objects and operations live in **C.3.1–C.3.5**; guard shapes are standardized in **C.3.A**.
