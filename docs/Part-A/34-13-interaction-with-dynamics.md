## 13 · Interaction with Dynamics (laws vs. abilities)

* **Dynamics** describe **how states evolve** (models, laws, trajectories).
* **Capability** says **what this system can achieve** within an WorkScope.
* Dynamics often serve as **evidence** or **explanatory models** for capability but are **not** the capability itself.

**Physics example:** an “isothermal process” (process here as transformation) is a **Work** instance whose path is explained by a **Dynamics** episteme; a lab rig’s ability to run that path repeatably is its **capability**.
