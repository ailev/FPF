## 15 · Closing notes *(governance & purity)*

* **Notation‑agnostic.** ULR is a **language constitution**, not a scanner or template. Apply it in prose, sketches, or formal models.
* **Where checks live.** Convenience checks belong to Tooling; ULR itself stays notation‑agnostic. Conformance code lives in **SCR‑LEX / RSCR‑LEX** as referenced above.
* **Acts vs tokens.** LEX applies to **tokens**; USM applies to **acts** (mint/rename/use). Conformance:
  `LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(usage) ∈ AllowedScopes(c)` (§ 7.5).
* **Guards honoured.** DevOps Lexical Firewall and Unidirectional Dependency remain intact.
* **Reserved “plane”.** Only **`CHR:ReferencePlane`** uses the bare word *plane*; I/D/S are **layers**; all other category talk is expressed as **Characteristics** in a **CharacteristicSpace**.

> **One‑line memory:** *“ULR keeps words honest so ideas stay composable.”*
