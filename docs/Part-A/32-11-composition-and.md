## 11 · Composition and Γ (how assembled systems “can do”)

Γ builds a **new holder** (a composite system). Its capability is not the algebraic sum of parts; it is an **ability of the whole** under its own WorkScope.

* **Express at the whole.** “Cell\_3 can place 12 PCB/min with ±0.1 mm” — that is a capability of **Cell\_3**, not of the pick‑and‑place head alone.
* **State dependencies.** “Valid while Feeder\_A delivers reels at ≥ X; vision subsystem calibrated ≤ 72 h ago.”
* **Constructor vs. transformer.** The **ConstructorRole** builds the composite (Γ); the resulting **TransformerRole** may later act on products. Capability belongs to the holder relevant to the action (builder’s ability vs operator’s ability).
