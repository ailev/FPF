| ID        | Anti‑pattern                     | Symptom                                                                           | Why it breaks thinking                              | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP‑1**  | **String‑equals ≡ sense‑equals** | Same surface used across Contexts with silent identity claims.                       | Violates locality; invites false substitution.      | Always state a **Bridge kind**; if unsure, default to **⋂ overlap** with **Naming‑only** scope.             |
| **AP-2**  | **Stealth substitution**         | “We’ll just treat A like B for now.”                                              | Hidden policy with unknown loss; leaks into Role Assignment & Enactment.    | Publish a **Bridge Card** with **Loss Notes** and **CL**; if CL<2, substitution remains **forbidden**.      |
| **AP‑3**  | **Stance jump by wording**        | “Activity (PROV) is a Process (BPMN).”                                            | Design ↔ run confusion; swaps graphs for events.    | Use **⇄ᴅʀ design↔run Interpretation Bridge**, **not** ≈/⊑; keep **Explanation‑only** scope.                 |
| **AP‑4**  | **Symmetry hallucination**       | Treating ⊑/⊒ as if they were symmetric.                                           | Narrows broadened, broadens narrowed; unsafe reuse. | Record **direction** explicitly; only **≈** is symmetric.                                                   |
| **AP-5**  | **Disjoint but reused**          | Declare ⊥ then still borrow labels or Role Description constraints (RCS/RSG).     | Contradiction between declaration and use.          | Either retract ⊥ or stop reuse; if a thin thread exists, rename as **contrastive explanation** (no row).    |
| **AP‑6**  | **CL without counter‑example**   | “These are CL=3” with no invariant check.                                         | Inflates trust; permits structural rows wrongly.    | For **CL=3**, cite the **matching invariants**; otherwise, demote to **CL=2** and add counter‑example.      |
| **AP‑7**  | **Bridge inflation**             | Dozens of nearly identical Bridges between the same Contexts.                        | Noise masks the few material alignments.            | Prefer **one Bridge per pair of Cells per senseFamily**; fold variants into **Loss Notes**.                       |
| **AP-8**  | **Row outruns Bridge**           | Concept-Set row claims Role Assignment & Enactment-eligibility where some participating Bridges are CL=1. | Row scope exceeds weakest link.                     | Apply **weakest-link rule** (F.7/F.8): row scope ≤ **min(CL)**; otherwise split the row.                    |
| **AP‑9**  | **Bridge as new U.Type**         | Using a Bridge to justify minting a new universal Type.                           | Re‑globalises meaning; breaks A.11 parsimony.       | Keep Types context‑local; where reuse is needed, use **rows** + Bridges, not new primitives.                   |
| **AP‑10** | **Silent unit/scale mismatch**   | Mapping measurements without unit/scale notes.                                    | Hidden dimensional error.                           | Record units/scales in **Loss Notes**; if units can’t be related, the kind is **⊥** or **⋂ (Naming‑only)**. |
