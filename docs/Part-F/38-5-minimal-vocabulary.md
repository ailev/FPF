## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — Tech‑register alias for **U.BoundedContext** (per E.10.D1).
* **Attested phrase** — A short, verbatim cue from the canon that shows how a word is used **in this Context** (citation idea, not a record format).
* **Local Normal Form (LNF)** — The Context‑specific canonical surface you will use when referring to the term in this Context (minimal editing: spelling/hyphenation/casing per the canon).
* **Two‑register label** — **Tech** (engineer‑facing) and **Plain** (pedagogic) forms for the same Context‑local meaning.
* **Gloss (one‑sentence)** — A **Context‑faithful** description of how the canon uses the term, at **minimal generality**.
* **Local lexical unit** — The quintet *(Context, LNF, Tech, Plain, Gloss)*. This is F.2’s only outcome.
* **Homonymy (signal)** — Awareness that the **same string** has **different local lexical units** across Contexts (no relation asserted).
* **SenseCell** *(appears downstream)* — Address **(Context × Local‑Sense)** minted in F.3; mentioned here so you know what you’re preparing.

> *Everything above is a way of thinking. None of it implies a database, statuses, or roles.*
