## 6 · Bias‑Annotation

* **Metric worship.** Treating `[F,G,R]` as ends rather than means; mitigation: require **evidence bindings** and narrative of limits in the Object envelope.
* **Category slip.** Equating a notation or its carrier with the Concept; mitigation: Symbol–carrier separation and EP‑1 triangle cardinality.
* **Analogy inflation.** Presenting CL‑0/1 as identity; mitigation: always name the **CL rung** for cross‑mappings.
