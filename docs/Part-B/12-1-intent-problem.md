## 1 · Intent & Problem

**Intent.** Turn Step 2 (*generate*) and Step 3 (*filter*) of the Abductive Loop from ad‑hoc brainstorming into a **disciplined, instrumented exploration** that can (i) *produce many* distinct, plausible hypotheses and (ii) *surface the few worth pursuing*—*without* bloating the kernel or forcing a specific creative method.

**Problem.** Unstructured ideation routinely fails on two fronts: it either produces *too little variety* (pet ideas win by seniority) or *too little plausibility* (grand theories with no testable predictions). **B.5.2** names these failure modes; this plug‑in adds a minimal, measurable counter‑mechanism aligned to FPF’s assurance lanes and state machine.
