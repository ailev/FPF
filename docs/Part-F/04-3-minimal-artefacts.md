## 3 · Minimal Artefacts (conceptual, notationally neutral)

> These artefacts are **thought‑objects**; they specify **what must exist conceptually**, not how it is stored.

### 3.1 **Context Card** (for each `U.BoundedContext`)

A terse descriptor used in the **Context Map** (F.1):

* `id` (stable local handle) · `title` · `edition/year`
* `family` (discipline family; informal) · `scope gist`
* `timeStance?` (`design` / `run`, if inherent)
* `trip‑wires` (few lexical caveats that often mislead, e.g., “*process*≠thermo process”)

### 3.2 **SenseCell** (unit of local meaning, inside one context)

* `label.tech` / `label.plain` (two registers)
* `gloss` (minimal generality, Context‑true)
* `notes?` (warnings, edition shifts)
* **No** behaviour/deontics/equations (C‑6)

> **Where it comes from.** F.2 describes how SenseCells can be *derived* from local term evidence; F.0.1 only **requires** that local meaning be expressible as a SenseCell.

### 3.3 **Alignment Bridge** (between SenseCells from different Contexts)

* `left: SenseCell⟨·@A⟩`, `right: SenseCell⟨·@B⟩`
* `relation` (e.g., *equivalent‑under‑assumptions*, *overlaps*, *broader‑than*)
* `CL` (Congruence Level; feeds B.3 Trust & Assurance)
* `loss/fit` (explicit statement of what is lost or assumed)
