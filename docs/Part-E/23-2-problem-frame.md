## 2 · Problem Frame

1. **Polysemy.** “Context” is used for formal scopes, narrative situations, and even runtime modes.
2. **Extra token (“anchor”).** “Anchor” pretends to be “where meaning is attached”, duplicating context semantics.
3. **Domain overreach.** “Domain context” conflates **families** (disciplinary areas) with **formal contexts**.
4. **Plane mixing.** Runtime/design stances and deontic/behavioural notions are smuggled into “context”.
