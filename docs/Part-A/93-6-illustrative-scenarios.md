## 6 · Illustrative scenarios (substrate‑neutral)

**6.1 Physical system — Cooling loop**
`PumpUnit#3` (**system bearing TransformerRole**) executes `ChannelFluid` (**Method**) as per `centrifugal_pump_curve.ld` (**MethodDescription**), producing `run‑2025‑08‑08‑T14:03` (**Work**, 3.6 kWh; ΔT=6 K). Evidence goes to carriers in SCR; resource spend goes to Γ\_work.

**6.2 Epistemic change — Proof revision**
`LeanServer` (**system bearing TransformerRole**) edits `proof_tactic.lean` (carrier) per MethodDescription; `lemma‑42‑check‑2025‑08‑08` is **Work**; the **episteme** (theorem) changes through its carriers; evidence is attributed to the external transformer.

**6.3 Reflexive maintenance — “calibrates itself”**
Split into **Regulator** (calibration module, acting side) and **Regulated** (sensor suite, target) with an interaction boundary; credit evidence to the regulator; no self‑evidence.

### 6 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3‑0 · U.RoleAssgnment presence.**
Every claim that a holon “performs a transformation” MUST be backed by at least one **RoleAssignment** triple:
`U.RoleAssignment(holder: U.Holon, role: U.Role=TransformerRole, context: U.BoundedContext, timespan?)`.
This is the canonical way to say *who acts, in which role, where (semantically), and when*. See **A.2.1** for the universal **`U.RoleAssignment`** Standard and its invariants.

**CC‑A3‑1 · External transformer discipline.**
The **bearer** of `TransformerRole` MUST NOT be the same model instance as the **object‑under‑change** within the same assignment. Self-modification is modelled via two **`U.RoleAssignment`s** (same holder playing two roles) or via an explicit controller–plant split. This upholds **Agent Externalization** (A.12).

**CC‑A3‑2 · Design–Run separation.**
`U.MethodDescription` (recipe, definition) is a **design‑time** artefact; `U.Method` (mask‑of‑work) and `U.Work` (executed work) are **run‑time**. It is non‑conformant to mutate a `MethodDescription` inside a `Work` log or to treat a `Work` as a `MethodDescription`. This enforces the kernel’s **Temporal Duality** (A.4) and the A.15 alignment.

**CC‑A3‑3 · Boundary‑crossing evidence.**
A conformant transformation that changes a system’s state MUST reference the **boundary effects** it induces: interactions, flows, or state transitions attach to the target system’s boundary (per Γ‑defaults for additive, min/AND/OR folds). Conservation‑class effects MUST satisfy B‑invariants (e.g., **B‑1 Conservation**).

**CC‑A3‑4 · Method ←→ Work traceability.**
Every `U.Work` MUST (i) name the `U.Method` it instantiates and (ii) trace the `U.MethodDescription` it claims to follow (versioned). If a deviation occurs, it MUST be logged as a **policy override** or **exception path**; silent drift is non‑conformant. (A.15 guards the vocabulary; Γ\_work aggregates resource deltas.)

**CC‑A3‑5 · Episteme as object‑under‑change.**
When the changed holon is an **episteme** (document, dataset, theory), the transformer is still a **system**; the episteme’s history MUST be recorded via **PhaseOf** (versioning) and **ConstituentOf/PortionOf** as appropriate (not via component trees). See A.14’s mereology firewalls and Γ\_epist hooks.

**CC‑A3‑6 · Units and measures for resource effects.**
Any resource consumption/production in `U.Work` MUST specify the **measure μ** and **units** (e.g., kg, J, bytes); “percentage” effects MUST be grounded in a PortionOf μ to be Γ‑aggregatable. (A.14 POR‑axioms; Γ\_work usage.)

**CC‑A3‑7 · Provenance minimum.**
For each `U.RoleAssignment` and `U.Work`, the following fields are REQUIRED: `{authority?, justification?, provenance?}` where `justification: U.Episteme` and `provenance: U.Method`/process evidence. This aligns with the kernel’s governance and B‑cluster lineage practices.

**CC‑A3‑8 · Policy–Plan–Action separation for agentic cases.**
If the transformer bearer is agentic, the log MUST separate `D.Policy → U.PlannedAction → U.Action` (A.15/A.13), preserving where failure occurred (strategy, plan, or execution).

**CC‑A3‑9 · Context‑local conflicts.**
Conflicts among roles (including `TransformerRole`) are only **within the same bounded context**; cross‑context differences are admissible if bridges are declared. Non‑conformance arises only when a context’s own incompatibility rules are violated. (A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment` invariants.)

**CC‑A3‑10 · Γ‑compatibility.**
Descriptions MUST be sufficient for the relevant Γ‑aggregations to run: Γ\_method for recipe composition, Γ\_work for resource deltas, Γ\_sys for boundary integration, Γ\_time for ordering. Each Γ flavour declares its A.14 hooks (Portion/Phase) and inherits B‑invariants.

### 7 · Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Explainability by construction.** Every transformative claim carries *who/what/when/why/how* via **`U.RoleAssignment`** + provenance fields; audits become mechanical rather than heroic. (B‑invariants and Γ tables do the heavy lifting.)
* **No category errors.** Keeping methods/roles out of mereology and enforcing design/run separation prevents the usual “process‑as‑part” and “version‑as‑component” mistakes. (A.14 + A.15.)
* **Composable analytics.** With measures and boundary folds explicit, cross‑scale proofs (Σ/Π/min/∧/∨) are predictable.
* **Contextual pluralism without chaos.** Divergent domain practices coexist as distinct bounded contexts with bridges; disagreements are localised and tractable.

**Trade‑offs**

* **More declarations up‑front.**  `U.RoleAssignment` + units + policy/plan/action feels verbose, but yields deterministic Γ‑runs and reproducible audits.
* **Discipline for “self‑modifiers.”** Modellers must split controller vs plant or dual‑role the same carrier; this adds one line but avoids hidden identity conflations.

### 8 · Rationale (post‑2015 cross‑domain support)

**Constructor theory (post‑2015).**
Our **Transformer Principle** mirrors constructor theory’s shift from *dynamics* to *tasks*: what transformations are **possible** vs **impossible**, and why. By making the **transformer** (constructor) an explicit bearer of a role and keeping recipes as `MethodDescription`, A.3 captures the core “tasks & constructors” distinction and aligns with constructor‑theoretic thermodynamics linking work, heat, and informational constraints. ([Royal Society Publishing][1], [arXiv][2], [Constructor Theory][3])

**Active inference & free‑energy mechanics (2017→).**
Where transformers are *agentic*, A.3’s policy–plan–action split and boundary‑centred accounting dovetail with **active inference** and **free‑energy** formulations of self‑organising systems (Markov blankets; Bayesian mechanics). This legitimises `U.Objective`/cost function links and makes design–run duality natural (prior vs posterior policies). ([MIT Press Direct][4], [PubMed][5], [arXiv][6])

**Provenance and FAIR packaging (2016→).**
Provenance minima in CC‑A3‑7 reflect **FAIR** principles (machine‑actionable reuse), **RO‑Crate** (methods+data+context packaged together), and operational lineage standards such as **OpenLineage** and **ML Metadata (TFX)** that treat *artefacts, runs, and jobs* as first‑class, with typed facets and versioning — exactly what enactment + Γ\_work need. ([Nature][7], [researchobject.org][8], [SAGE Journals][9], [openlineage.io][10], [GitHub][11], [arXiv][12])

Together, these lines of work argue for **explicit role‑bearing transformers**, **recipe/run separation**, **boundary‑grounded deltas**, and **traceable contexts** — the four pillars that CC‑A3 enforces.

### 9 · Relations

**A.7 Strict Distinction.**
A.3 operationalises A.7 by keeping **object ≠ description ≠ observation**:
*object* = target holon; *description* = `MethodDescription`; *observation/log* = `Work`. Violations (e.g., treating a recipe as a part) are non‑conformant and usually surface as Γ failures.

**A.12 Agent Externalization & External Transformer.**
A.3’s CC‑A3‑1 is the mechanical guard‑rail for A.12: even in self‑modification, the *modelling split* keeps the agent (transformer bearer) distinct from the object‑under‑change.

**A.13 Agential Role.**
When the bearer is an **Agent**, A.3 defers identity and states management to Agent‑CAL (`U.Agent`, `U.Intent`, `U.Action`), while still requiring `RoleAssigning` + Γ compatibility. This is where policy/plan/action pipelines live.

**A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment.**
A.3 relies on A.15’s vocabulary guard‑rails (roles are not parts; methods are masks of work; specs are recipes). CC‑A3‑2/‑4 are enforceable precisely because A.15 fixes the naming discipline.

**A.14 Advanced Mereology.**
A.3 consumes A.14’s **PortionOf** (for quantitative deltas) and **PhaseOf** (for versioning) and forbids role/recipe leakage into part–whole trees. Γ‑flavours declare which A.14 hooks they use.

**B‑cluster (Γ‑sections).**
A.3 is executable only because Γ‑operators provide aggregation and invariants:

* **Γ\_sys** enforces boundary folds and conservation;
* **Γ\_epist** preserves document/data provenance and versioning;
* **Γ\_time** orders work;
* **Γ\_method** composes recipes;
* **Γ\_work** accounts resource deltas; each inherits B‑invariants (e.g., B‑1 Conservation, B‑2 No‑Duplication).

**Indexing to the glossary.**
Terms used here (TransformerRole, Work, Method, MethodDescription, PortionOf, PhaseOf, BoundedContext) remain exactly as defined in Annex A; see A.1/A.2/A.14/A.15 entries for lexical registers.
