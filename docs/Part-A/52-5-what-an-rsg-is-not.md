## 5 · What an RSG is **not** (guardrails)

* **Not a workflow.** RSG transitions do **not** encode task order; they encode **eligibility changes** of the *role*.
* **Not a capability list.** RSG is **authorization/readiness over time**, distinct from `U.Capability` (ability).
* **Not a global status set.** RSG lives **inside one Context**; the label *Ready* in another Context is **a different state** unless bridged (F.9).
* **Not a log.** RSG is not a history. Histories are **StateAssertions** over Windows; **`U.Work`** is the record of enactments.
* **Not a document lifecycle.** Epistemic role RSGs can *look like* document lifecycles, but they remain **role‑status graphs**; the **carrier** lifecycle stays separate (A.7, `U.Carrier`).
