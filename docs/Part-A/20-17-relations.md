## 17 · Relations (where this pattern sits)

**Builds on / depends on**

* **A.1 Holonic Foundation** — `U.Holon` (holders).
* **A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`** — the “Context of meaning.”
* **A.2 Role Taxonomy** — role families (Agential / Transformer / Observer / Speech; Epistemic‑Status / Normative / Service‑Governance).
* **E.10.D1 (D.CTX)** & **E.10.D2 (Strict Distinction of intensional vs description)** — locality & description discipline.

**Enables / instantiated by**

* **A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment** — step gating, performer linking, evaluation hooks.
* **B.1 Γ‑algebra** — constructors/observers are simply roles enacted by systems.
* **B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus** — CL penalties on Bridges; evidence from StateAssertions.
* **D.2 Multi‑Scale Ethics** — duties attach to roles; SoD encoded via `⊥`.
* **F‑cluster (Unification Method)** — F.1–F.4 define Contexts and local senses; F.9 defines Bridges consumed here.

**Interacts with**

* **C.* Architheories*\* (Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Method‑CAL, CHR‑CAL) — enactment hooks, measurement via Observations.
* **Service & Deontics (Part D/E)** — obligations and acceptance evaluated against role‑gated Work.
