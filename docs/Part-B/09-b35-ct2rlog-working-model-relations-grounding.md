## B.3.5 · **CT2R‑LOG — Working-Model Relations & Grounding** *(LOG‑use)*

> **One‑line summary.**
> CT2R‑LOG treats the everyday **Working‑Model relations**— **ut:ComponentOf**, **ut:MemberOf**, **ut:PortionOf**, **ut:AspectOf** —as the **publication surface** for structure, while binding each published edge to a **grounding trace** and a **declared `tv:validationMode`**. Authors keep using a short list of relations; reviewers get reconstructible provenance.

### 1) Intent

*Provide a single, human‑facing family of **Working‑Model** relations as the **publication surface**, with explicit hooks for (G) grounding and (R) reliability—without exposing constructor jargon or burdening day‑to‑day authors.*

**What you get (manager/engineer view).**
 The same relations you already know (e.g., **ComponentOf**) remain the **public interface**.

**What changes (auditor/ontologist view).**
* Each published edge carries two additional commitments:

  1. **`tv:groundedBy`** → points to a **reconstructible trace** (e.g., `Γ_m.sum`) whenever the edge is *structural*.
  2. **`validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`** → declares how the author justifies the assertion.

This is the **alias‑plus‑grounding** split: **Compose‑CAL** builds the trace; **CT2R‑LOG** declares the alias pattern and links it; **Lang‑CHR** supplies the labels.

### 2) Problem frame & forces (why this pattern exists)

* **Two audiences, one dial.** Project managers want **one relation family** and stable views; ontologists want **generative completeness** and extensional identity.
* **Parsimony constraint.** The Kernel stays minimal; construction is **outside** the Kernel.
* **Unification inside FPF.** We already unify external vocabularies; the same discipline is applied **internally** so *every* architheory that needs mereology rides on **one generative basis** and **one alias façade**.

### 3) Problem

Declared sub‑relations of `ut:PartOf` (e.g., **ComponentOf**, **MemberOf**) are easy to use but **not self‑justifying**: nothing in their declaration shows *why* a given edge should be trusted, or how to **re‑derive** it if challenged. Conversely, exposing constructor traces everywhere makes the graph unreadable to non‑specialists.

**We need**: a stable **publication surface** for relations *and* a mandatory, **reconstructible** **grounding channel**—plus a visible **validation intent** that downstream assurance can reason about.

---

### 4) Solution (thumbnail)

CT2R‑LOG introduces a **two‑link discipline** around each canonical edge:

1. **Alias link (concept‑level).**
   **Working‑Model relations** (e.g., `ut:ComponentOf`) are **alias patterns** over a general constructional principle. Denote by **`tv:AliasOf`**.

2. **Grounding link (evidence‑level).**
   Each **edge instance** carries **`tv:groundedBy`**:

   * **MANDATORY** for **all structural edges** (sub-properties of `ut:StructPartOf`): the target is a valid **`Γ_m` trace** from **Compose-CAL** (one of `sum`, `set`, `slice`). **Set** `validationMode=axiomatic`; **`postulate` SHALL NOT be used for structural edges**.
   * **Optional** for **epistemic edges** (e.g., `ConstituentOf`, `RepresentationOf`): if no `Γ_m` trace is appropriate, attach an **evidence object** whose admissibility is governed by the declared **`validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`** (assurance rules).

2. **Validation flag (author intent).**
   Every declared edge or aggregation rule carries **`tv:validationMode`** with one of:
   * **`postulate`** — pragmatic working claim backed by observations;
   * **`inferential`** — reasoned consequence (proof outline);
   * **`axiomatic`** — constructive grounding via a `Γ_m.*` composition.

> **F–G–R alignment.**
> **F** (the published *Fact*): `:PumpA ut:ComponentOf :Skid12`.
> **G** (its *Grounding*): `:e123 tv:groundedBy :trace_Γm_sum_456`.
> **R** (declared *Reliability mode*): `tv:validationMode=axiomatic` → inputs B.3.3’s **AssuranceLevel** assessment.

### 5) Vocabulary & notation (normative)

* **Working-Model relations (front‑stage).**
 `ut:ComponentOf`, `ut:PortionOf`, `ut:AspectOf` are **publication-grade** sub-properties of `ut:StructPartOf` **(structural)**; `ut:MemberOf` is a sub-property of `ut:EpiPartOf` **(epistemic)**. 

* **Alias principle (lexical).**
  `tv:AliasOf` links a **relation type** to its **generative rule schema** (e.g., “`ComponentOf` aliases the result of a `Γ_m.sum` with role=component”).

* **Grounding (per‑edge).**
 `tv:groundedBy` on an *edge instance* **MUST** point to a **Γₘ trace** (`sum|set|slice`) for **structural** edges (**set** `validationMode=axiomatic`); for **epistemic** edges it **MAY** point to an **evidence object** or a logical proof per declared `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`. 

* **Trace family.**
  `Γ_m.sum`, `Γ_m.set`, `Γ_m.slice` are the only normative constructors for structural grounding; no temporal or workflow constructor is added here (time slices live in Sys‑CAL; parallelism via `set`).

* **Validation flag.**
 `tv:validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}` is **required** on every declared edge or aggregation rule; **for structural edges `postulate` is disallowed**.

### 6) Running example (didactic)

> **Story.** A refinery team publishes `:PumpA ut:ComponentOf :Skid12`.

* **Publication — Working-Model surface.**
  They mint one edge with the **Working-Model** relation **ComponentOf** and **declare the surface’s `U.Formality`** (typically **F≈F3**, controlled narrative). Only the publication surface is visible to readers.

* **Constructive grounding (Γₘ).**
  In the background, the edge node records `tv:groundedBy :trace_Γₘ_sum_456`. That trace is a **Compose-CAL** “sum” that lists the parts aggregated into the skid. Any auditor can **replay** the trace to prove extensional identity. *(Grounding does not change the surface’s F; it sets `validationMode=axiomatic` and contributes to **R** in the **VA** lane.)*

* **Assurance stance & R-lane.**
 Because the edge is construction-backed, authors set `tv:validationMode=axiomatic`. B.3.3 reads the flag and assigns an **AssuranceLevel** in the appropriate **R** lane (scale defined in B.3.3). **F**, **G**, and **R** remain **orthogonal**: this move raises assurance without changing claim scope (**G**) or the surface’s formality (**F**).

* **Contrast (epistemic).**
When the same team asserts `:MassFlowRepresentation RepresentationOf :FlowModel`, they declare `validationMode=postulate` and attach a calibration dataset (Empirical Validation) instead of a **Γₘ** trace. The edge remains publishable, but reviewers record a lower-confidence stance, and B.3.4’s **evidence ageing** policy will decay its trust over time.
  
Result: **one** visible relation for engineers, **two** hidden anchors for assurance.

### 7) Author Standard (at a glance)

When you add or import a relation edge:

1. **Pick a Working‑Model relation** (ComponentOf/MemberOf/…); avoid raw `ut:PartOf` unless you are drafting meta‑level axioms.
   
2. **Attach `tv:groundedBy`**:

   * Structural? → **must** be a `Γ_m` trace ID.
   * Epistemic? → `Γ_m` trace *or* evidence object.
3. **Declare `tv:validationMode`** (**postulate** / **inferential** / **axiomatic**).

> **What managers see:** nothing new in the graph picture.
> **What auditors get:** a reliable trail from every published edge back to a principled constructor or an evidence pack.

### 8) Compatibility & cross‑references

* **B.3.2 (LOG‑use).** CT2R‑LOG supplies the **places to hang proofs/evidence** that B.3.2 formalizes.
* **B.3.3 (Assurance levels).** `validationMode` + presence/quality of `tv:groundedBy` are the **inputs** to compute `AssuranceLevel (L0–L2)`.
* **B.3.4 (Evidence ageing).** If an edge relies on **postulated evidence**, its confidence **decays** per that pattern until refreshed; **axiomatic** edges from `Γ_m` traces do not age, but their **inputs** (tokens) might.
