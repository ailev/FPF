## 12 · Didactic quick cards (engineer‑manager ready)

* **Dynamics = Law of Change.** A design‑time model of how states evolve.
* **State space = Named characteristics with units.** No vague “axes”.
* **Method vs Dynamics.** Method decides *what we do*; Dynamics predicts *what will happen*.
* **Work = Evidence.** Only Work has timestamps and resource actuals.
* **Conformance = Prediction vs Trace.** Fit, residuals, drift.
* **Keep promises separate.** Services are promises; Dynamics informs them but does not replace them.

**Memory hook:** **Method decides · Dynamics predicts · Work reveals.**
