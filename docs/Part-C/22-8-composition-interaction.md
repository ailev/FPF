## 8 · Composition & Interaction (normative + informative notes)

### 8.1 · Inside one episteme (normative)

* **Essential paths.** Identify essential parts/claims that are required for the episteme’s truth. Apply **min‑F** along each support path; the **episteme‑level F** is the min over essential paths (CC‑F‑7, CC‑F‑8).
* **Episteme‑about (ReferencePlane=episteme).** Descriptions about other claims/epistemes carry their **own** F and do **not** raise the target’s F; any cross‑plane penalty flows via **CL^plane → R**.

> **Note (informative).** A long formal appendix (F8) attached to a largely narrative body (F3) does **not** make the whole F8; the episteme remains **F3** unless the core claims move into the formal appendix.

### 8.2 · Relation to **G** (scope/envelope) (normative)

* F concerns the **expression form** of the claim; G concerns its **claim scope**. Tightening the envelope without changing how the claim is expressed does not change F; re‑expressing the claim in a stricter form (e.g., predicates) can raise F without changing G.

> **Caution (informative).** Raising F often **reveals** hidden assumptions, which may lead to a **ΔG** (narrower envelope). Treat this as a **separate** change: update G explicitly rather than smuggling scope changes under F.

### 8.3 · Relation to **R** (evidence/assurance) (normative)

* **F ≠ R.** Proof‑grade expression (F7+) still requires binding to appropriate assurance lanes (VA/LA/TA) in the trust calculus; empirical claims may have high R with low F if they remain informal.
* **Decay independence.** F **does not decay** with time; R may decay (empirical freshness) or shift due to CL. Tool assurance (TA) is tracked independently of F.

> **Note (informative).** Higher F typically **enables** stronger R (easier to test or prove), but no automatic relationship is assumed.

### 8.4 · CL & Bridges (normative)

* **CL effects.** Using content across context boundaries requires a Bridge with a CL rating. CL affects **R** (penalties) and **never** changes **F** (CC‑F‑12/13).
* **Semantic change ⇒ new episteme.** If a cross‑context mapping **alters** the claim (e.g., coarsens predicates, drops obligations), treat it as a **new episteme** with its own F rather than “the same F with lower CL.”

### 8.5 · Motion primitives (informative)

* **ΔF** raises or (rarely) lowers the rigor of expression. Plan ΔF moves independently of **ΔG**/**ΔR**: projects often alternate “raise F” (make the claim checkable) with “raise R” (gather proof/validation) at a fixed G.
* **Cost signals.** Typical costs: authoring overhead (F3→F4), model encoding (F4→F5/6), proof engineering (F6→F7/8). The benefit is reduced ambiguity and safer composition.

### 8.6 · Gaps & thresholds (informative)

* **F‑gap** = ordinal difference between two F anchors (no arithmetic). Large gaps signal translation risk: an F8‑level component will not accept informal inputs (F2) except via additional formalization (ΔF) or robust alignment (CL‑guarded).
