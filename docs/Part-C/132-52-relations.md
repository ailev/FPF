**To A.17 / A.18.** C.16 *uses* A.17’s canonical **Characteristic** and A.18’s **CSLC sufficiency**; it neither re‑states nor weakens them.
**To Part F.** C.16 is the **exporting architheory** behind measurement rows in UTS/Bridges (e.g., **result‑value** ↔ SOSA `Result`, ISO `QuantityValue`).
**To Arch‑CAL.** Architectural qualities (*Coupling, Cohesion, Evolvability*) become **Characteristics** measured via C.16 templates; architectural dynamics read as trajectories in **CharacteristicSpace** (A.17 context).
