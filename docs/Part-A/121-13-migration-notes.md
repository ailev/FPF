## 13 · Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Label the artifacts.** Wherever a repo/diagram/document “is the process,” rename it **MethodDescription** and link it to a named **Method**.
2. **Extract people and calendars.** Move all assignees to **RoleAssigning** and all schedules to **WorkPlan**.
3. **Introduce parameter blocks.** Add a small “Parameters” section with ranges/defaults and safety guards.
4. **Write acceptance criteria.** Especially for search/optimization or ML specs.
5. **Declare equivalence/refinement.** Where two notations intend “the same way,” add an **equivalence note**; where the new one tightens bounds, declare **refinement**.
6. **Bridge domains.** If two departments use different vocabularies, add a **Bridge (`U.Alignment`)** rather than forcing a single spec.
