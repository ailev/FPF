## 4 · Forces  \[I]

| Force                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local freedom vs global sense** | Contexts need their own vocabularies; Cross‑context work needs a common skeleton for **describedEntity**.      |
| **Minimality vs utility**         | The notion of kind must be tiny yet powerful enough to guide ΔF/ΔR/bridges/composition.            |
| **Intent vs extent**              | Kinds come with a **definition** and a **population in place**; both are needed and must not mix.  |
| **Typed discipline vs F–G–R**     | Typed safety must not distort **G** (Scope) nor introduce a parallel “assurance math.”             |
| **Abstraction vs applicability**  | “Higher abstraction” is **not** “wider applicability”; the framework must make this split obvious. |
