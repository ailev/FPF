## 10 · Trade‑offs & mitigations

* **Cognitive effort.** Interpreting Pareto sets and coverage maps adds thinking overhead. *Mitigation:* standard “NQD Card” + default grids; keep **Characteristics** small in number (≤ 7). *Manager shortcut:* pick 2–3 **Q** characteristics that reflect the anomaly, then run with defaults.
* **Locality.** Novelty/diversity are **context‑local**; Cross‑context reuse requires **re‑measurement or an explicit mapping**. This pattern **does not define** Cross‑context operational controls.
* **Not a magic idea machine.** Abduction remains human/agentic; the plug‑in *structures* search, it does not automate insight. B.5’s abductive primacy stands.
* **Metric gaming & collinearity.** Avoid making **N** and **S** redundant by policy; when strong collinearity is detected, freeze one as informative only and record rationale in the DRR.
