## 4 · Forces (Informative)

**F1 — Interpretability first.** A value detached from its Characteristic/Scale is meaningless; CSLC supplies minimum context.
**F2 — Transdisciplinarity.** Physics, architecture, curation, sport judging—*one* substrate must cover all while respecting scale types and polarity.
**F3 — Intension vs description.** Confusing the **Characteristic** (intensional object) with its rubric or exemplar text (descriptions) corrupts claims; C.16 keeps them distinct.
**F4 — Comparability without coercion.** Ordinal ≠ interval; ratio admits unit change, ordinal does not; polarity matters for “better/worse”. C.16 encodes these **as conceptual constraints**, not formulas.
**F5 — Evidence sufficiency.** A measure should be *checkable in principle*; evidence is a **conceptual link** (not storage advice).
**F6 — Lexical discipline.** One canon in normative register; narrative labels are didactic only (Part E). C.16 reuses E.10’s **register mapping**.
