## 1 · Purpose & Audience

This pattern gives **one small, stable vocabulary** to say *what* a claim ranges over (its **describedEntity**) without entangling that with *where it applies* (Scope) or *how well it is supported* (R). For managers:

* It prevents the costly mistake “more abstract wording ⇒ wider scope.”
* It enables **typed composition** (you cannot combine claims about incompatible “things”).
* It keeps **Scope** and **Assurance** math unchanged and predictable.
