**A Bridge is a declared translator between two local senses.**
It always names **(a)** the two **SenseCells**, **(b)** a **Bridge‑kind** (what relation), **(c)** a **direction** (if non‑symmetric), **(d)** a **CL** (how strong), and **(e)** **Loss Notes** (what fails to carry). Some Bridges **permit substitution** in limited scopes; others **permit only explanation**.
