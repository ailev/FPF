* **Formal lift (ΔF).** Recasting a 2019 **variational free‑energy** narrative into a typed calculus raises **F**, clarifies scope, and enables CL‑2 bridges between biological and ML formulations—*without* claiming empirical gain (**R** unchanged).
* **Parallel evidence (R, max).** Two independent **hindcast** lines (circa CMIP6, 2019) supporting the same forecast allow `R(Γ)=max(R₁,R₂)`; if one line drifts, the composite is bounded by the stronger line until series constraints apply.
* **Notation bridge (CL drop).** A 2021 **type‑theoretic specification** rendered in a semi‑formal DSL requires a `NotationBridge` with a CL<3 note; any theorem transported across must respect the bridge’s declared preservation.

*(No tooling is implied; these are conceptual moves within the calculus.)*
