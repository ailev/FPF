## 5 · Clear distinctions (litmus tests managers can apply)

| If you are talking about…                  | Use                     | Litmus test                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **assignment** (who is being what, where) | **Role → Role assignment** | Can you reassign to another holder without changing the system’s composition? If yes → Role. |
| **Ability** (can do within bounds)         | **Capability**          | Would you still say “can do” even if not currently assigned? If yes → Capability.           |
| **Recipe** (how‑to)                        | **Method / MethodDescription** | Has inputs/outputs and steps but no date/time.                                               |
| **Execution** (what happened)              | **Work**                | Has a start/end, consumed resources, left a log.                                             |
| **External promise**                       | **Service**             | Framed as “we provide/guarantee to others.”                                                  |
| **Law/model of change**                    | **Dynamics**            | Describes state evolution, not an ability of one system.                                     |

**Two useful corollaries**

* A step in a Method may **require** a Role; **optionally** it may also stipulate a **capability threshold** (e.g., precision ≤ 0.2 mm). assignment and ability are checked separately.
* A Service depends on **having** the needed capabilities **and** being **assigned** to deliver under the Service’s context.
