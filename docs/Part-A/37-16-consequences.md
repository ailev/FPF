| **Truthful planning.** Schedulers and managers can ask “can do?” independently of “assigned now?” | **Extra column in tables.** Adding scope/measures/valid‑through is a small burden that repays itself in fewer reschedules. |
| **Safer gating.** Steps gate on both role and ability; fewer silent failures.                      | **Two checks instead of one.** Keep the checklist simple: *badge + bounds*.                                                   |
| **Clear service design.** Services become explicit promises built on visible abilities.            | **Temptation to over‑promise.** Keep service SLOs within demonstrated capability measures.                                    |
| **Clean separation with Dynamics and PBS/SBS.** No more “process” or “function” soup.              | **Some retraining.** Use the litmus tables (from the lexical rules) during onboarding.                                        |
