**Name.** *Measurement & Metrics Characterization (MM‑CHR).* This is user-oriented name: in user‑facing narrative we say ‘metrics’; in Tech register we speak `U.DHCMethodRef`/`U.Measure`.
**Intent.** Provide a **transdisciplinary substrate for measurement** that any architheory can rely on: a small, stable set of intensional constructs and relations—**`U.DHCMethodRef`**, **`U.Measure`**, **`U.Unit`**, **`U.EvidenceStub`**—disciplined by **CSLC** (*Characteristic / Scale / Level / Coordinate*) so that every recorded value is **interpretable** and **comparable** across CG‑frames (physics lab time‑of‑flight, figure‑skating judging, architectural modularity, etc.). **C.16** does **not** re‑define **Characteristic** (A.17) nor the CSLC kernel Standard (A.18); instead, it **exports** the measurement substrate that *binds* an architheory’s metric notions to **one Characteristic and one Scale** and frames a **conceptual link to evidence**. This characterization is **notation‑neutral**, **tool‑agnostic**, and **open‑ended** (no “lifecycle” narrative; evolution proceeds via **RSG** moves with checklists). 

**Outcomes.**
(1) A uniform way for architheories to *declare* what is measured and *read* what has been measured; (2) explicit **Characteristic anchoring** and **Scale typing** per CSLC; (3) principled **comparability** and **polarity** (declared at the template level); (4) **traceability** via conceptual evidence stubs; (5) seamless alignment with cross‑domain quantity notions (ISO 80000, ISO/IEC 25024, QUDT, SOSA/SSN, Verspoor) through Unification rows (Part F).
