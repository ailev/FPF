## 11 · Glossary & Notation (normative where noted)

**Formality (F).** `U.Formality` — an **ordinal Characteristic** with polarity **up**; default anchors **F0…F9** (§5). *(Normative)*

**Anchor (F‑anchor).** A named qualitative milestone on the F scale (e.g., F4 “first‑order constraints”). Sub‑anchors are context‑local refinements that **preserve order**. *(Normative)*

**ΔF.** A change to the expression form that alters F (usually **up**). Record as an episteme content change. *(Normative)*

**Essential part/path.** A part or claim without which the episteme’s central assertion does not hold. Composition applies **min‑F** along essential support paths. *(Normative)*

**Predicate / Invariant.** A typed, checkable statement about objects/states; at **F4** and above, critical claims are expressed as such.

**Machine‑checked / Proof‑carrying.** Content for which a logic kernel/type system rejects incorrect changes (F7+) or where programs and proofs are the same artifact (F8).

**Higher equality / Univalence.** Treatment of equivalence as identity in higher foundations relevant at **F9**.

**Notation & examples.**

* Declare as `F = Fk` (e.g., `F = F4`).
* Sub‑anchor: `F = F4[OCL]` or `F = F7[HOL]`.
* Thresholds in prose: “requires **F ≥ F6** for core claims.”
* Mixed parts: list per part if useful (e.g., “Body F3; Appendix proofs F7 — **episteme F3**”).
