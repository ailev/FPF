## 16 · Migration cues (conceptual)

1. **When in doubt, fork—not overwrite.** New edition? **Add a Context** unless you can argue sense identity in one sentence.
2. **Name pain → aliases, not merges.** If a label confuses, **rename with an alias**; if meaning changed, **mint new**.
3. **Rows age gracefully.** Never retrofit a row; **retire and re‑row** when any cell’s sense shifts.
4. **Bridges get colder over time.** Prefer to **lower CL** when editions drift; raising CL needs fresh witnesses.
5. **Windows absorb variation.** Resist splitting Status types; **window** by time/scale/phase.
6. **Guard SoD early.** When binding composite responsibilities (F.14), check SoD before naming.
7. **Teach the delta.** When things evolve, write one‑breath deltas (“what changed, why it matters”) as part of the example narrative—no registries implied.
