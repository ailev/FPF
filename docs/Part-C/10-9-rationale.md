## 9 · Rationale

KD‑CAL externalises a long‑standing semiotic insight (Sign–Meaning–Referent) into a **holonic composition** where syntax/structure (**F,G**), pragmatics/evidence (**R**), and cross‑mapping strength (**CL**) are visible and composable. The explicit triangle (C.2.1) prevents carrier confusion; the characteristic provide a **manager‑readable** yet **formalisation‑ready** scale (with **G** grounded in **scope/envelope**, not part‑count); the CL ladder replaces overloaded “alignment” with a graded sameness notion.
