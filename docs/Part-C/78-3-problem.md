## 3 · Problem

1. **Semantic drift.** Moving a claim into a target‑context with a different taxonomy changes “what counts” without anyone noticing.
2. **Hidden order breaks.** Subkind relationships invert or vanish; downstream proofs/tests are misapplied.
3. **Entangled channels.** Teams conflate “scope mapping” with “kind mapping,” making it impossible to assign penalties coherently.
4. **Incomputable guards.** “We map it somehow” yields non‑deterministic classification at guard time.
