## 2 · Problem

Teams routinely entangle **programs, specifications, proofs, and datasets**; a “proof” is treated as a tested routine, a “program” is cited as if it entailed a theorem. **Trust decays** because justification and evidence freshness are not explicit. Epistemes are anthropomorphised as actors (“the standard enforces…”), producing **category errors at execution**. Without a shared composition and equivalence calculus, aggregates hide weakest links and analogies harden into overclaims. KD‑CAL must stop these failure modes with a **single constitution and scale‑set**.
