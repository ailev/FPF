## 9 · MethodDescription mereology (epistemic composition; not method composition)

Keep two worlds separate:

* **Method composition (design‑time semantic):** combines Methods into **new Methods** (A.3.1 §9).
* **MethodDescription mereology (epistemic):** combines **documents/code/models** into larger **spec artifacts**. This is about **parts of the description**, not about the semantic method algebra.

**Epistemic part relations (illustrative):**

* **`ConstituentOf`** — a chapter/module/snippet is a constituent of a larger spec.
* **`Imports/Uses`** — this spec reuses a library/rule set.
* **`VariantOf`** — this spec is a variant (e.g., for different equipment) with declared deltas.
* **`RepresentationOf`** — this visual diagram is a representation of the textual rule set.

**Didactic rule:** Do not infer that a spec with two modules **means** a Method with “two steps.” Modules are **parts of the description**, not necessarily steps of the Method.
