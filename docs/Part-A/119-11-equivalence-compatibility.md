## 11 · Equivalence & compatibility (across notations and contexts)

**Within one context.**

* Use **semantic equivalence** (CC‑A3.2‑8) to assert that BPMN vs code vs solver model are the **same Method**.
* Prefer a short **equivalence note** showing parity of pre/post/bounds.

**Across contexts.**

* Treat identity as **not guaranteed**.
* Provide **Bridges (`U.Alignment`)** that map terms, units, roles, and acceptance criteria.
* Be explicit if one spec is only **sound** (never returns forbidden outcomes) vs **complete** (can return all allowed outcomes).

**Observational perspective (pragmatic).**
Two specs are observationally equivalent for stakeholders **if**, under declared conditions, they are indistinguishable by the acceptance tests of that context (even if internal strategies differ).
