**Three families, two modalities, one habit.**
Treat every status word as a **SenseCell with a declared StatusModality** and **inside one Context**. When you must relate statuses across Contexts, **declare a Bridge** (F.9) that says *what kind of relation*, *how strong (CL)*, *which way (if narrower/broader)*, and *what is lost*. Prefer **explanation** Bridges; permit **substitution** only when kind/CL allow it.

**Reading an Episteme.** For every `U.Episteme`, read _Object_ (what it is about), _Concept_ (model/postulates), _Symbol_ (carriers). **Statuses classify the Episteme;** enactment remains with `U.System` and `U.Work`. (Formal identity rules: see **KD‑CAL**.)
