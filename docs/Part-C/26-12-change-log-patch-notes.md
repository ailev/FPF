## 12 · Change Log & Patch Notes (normative migration)

**12.1 Supersession.**
This pattern **supersedes** the legacy “modes/tiers” language. Any references to “M‑mode/F‑mode”, “publication tiers”, or parallel “formality ladders” are **deprecated**. From now on, **Formality** is expressed **only** as **F** with default anchors **F0…F9** (and optional sub‑anchors per §4.3).

**12.2 Impacted cross‑references.**

* **C.2.2 (F–G–R).** Replace any generic “F‑ladder” description with a normative reference to **C.2.3** and treat **F** in the triple as defined here (including **min‑F** composition).
* **ESG/RSG text.** Where guards previously referenced “modes/tiers,” rewrite guards as **`F ≥ Fk`** conditions.
* **Meta‑descriptions.** Ensure meta‑artifacts carry **their own F** and do not “lift” a target artifact’s F; use **CL→R** for cross‑context penalties, not F changes.

**12.3 Transitional guidance.**

* **Legacy artifacts without F.** Assign an initial F by applying the rubric in **§6**; record the assignment as a content attribution (not as a status change).
* **Legacy labels in prose.** Replace them with explicit **F** declarations. If prose implies mixed rigor, rate by the **weakest essential** segment (see §7.3).
* **No dual systems.** Do not keep “modes” alongside F; remove proxies and speak **F directly**.

**12.4 Backward compatibility (non‑normative note).**
During editorial refresh, it is acceptable to annotate historical records with both the **new F** and the legacy note for provenance. Forward‑looking reasoning and composition, however, **SHALL** use **F only**.

**12.5 Versioning & edits.**
Raising or (exceptionally) lowering **F** constitutes a **content change** (ΔF). Whether such a change triggers a new edition in a given Context is **outside this pattern**; respect the Context’s edition policy while keeping **F** accurate.
