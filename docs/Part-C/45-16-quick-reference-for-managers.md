## 16 · Quick reference for managers  \[I]

### 16.1 · 10‑minute start

1. Name the **Kind** your claim talks about.
2. Write **Scope (G)** as slice predicates (with **Γ\_time**).
3. If composing, check **`⊑`** or **KindBridge** first.
4. Use the **typed guard macro** (C.3.A).
5. Route bridge levels to **R** (Φ/Ψ); check freshness.

### 16.2 · 30‑day rollout plan

Week 1: Inventory & name Kinds (K1); adopt guard macros.
Week 2: Draft **KindSignature** for the top 5 Kinds (aim **F4**); register masks.
Week 3: Wire **two‑bridge rule** into ESG; add CL/`CL^k` lines to decision templates.
Week 4: Promote repeated masks to subkinds; publish first **KindBridge** records with loss notes.
