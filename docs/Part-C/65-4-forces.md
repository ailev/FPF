| Force                              | Tension to resolve                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local freedom vs comparability** | Contexts need their own notations, but membership must be checkable in a common style.                  |
| **Expressivity vs determinism**    | Rich intent is welcome, but membership must be deterministic given `slice`.                          |
| **Intent vs applicability**        | Define “what counts” (intent/extent) without encoding “where valid” (G).                             |
| **Rigor vs cost**                  | Raising signature F has cost; the framework must support low‑F drafts and high‑F safety cores alike. |
