## 8 · Invariants (normative)

1. **DesignRunTag honesty.** Statements about **Method/MethodDescription** (design) **MUST NOT** be used as if they were statements about **Work/Actuation** (run) without an explicit Bridge and Window.
2. **Box discipline.** Every claim about “how”, “recipe”, “run”, or “control output” **MUST** point to the correct box in the quartet.
3. **Context locality.** Terms (*process*, *activity*, *task*, *command*) **MUST** be read as **SenseCells** in their Contexts (F.3); Cross‑context equivalence is a matter for F.7/F.9 Bridges.
4. **Status placement.** *Approved* attaches to MethodDescription; *Observed/Measured* attach to Work; *Satisfied/Violated* attach to clauses about Work outcomes within a **Window** (F.10).
5. **Actuation as Work‑part.** Actuation **MUST** be modelled as **occurring within** (or as a specialised form of) Work on the run stance; it does **not** replace Work.
6. **Naming clarity.** Technical/Plain labels for the quartet **SHOULD** be distinct (F.5); avoid homonymous single‑word labels when Contexts collide.
7. **Bridge guard.** Cross‑context moves **MUST** declare **kind** (≈, ⊑, ⊒, ⋂, ⊥, Interpretation), **CL**, and **Loss** (F.7/F.9).
