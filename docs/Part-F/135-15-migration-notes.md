## 15 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Edition shift in a Context.** Re‑read affected **Cells**; if sense moved, split the Bridge or **lower CL**; keep the older Bridge for historical claims.
2. **New evidence of mismatch.** Add a **counter‑example**; **decrease CL** or change **kind** (e.g., from ≈ to ⊑ or ⋂).
3. **Convergence over time.** When invariants demonstrably match, and counter‑examples evaporate, **raise CL** cautiously; for **CL=3**, cite invariants.
4. **senseFamily refactor.** If a Cell’s senseFamily was mis‑typed, fix the senseFamily first in F.3, then revisit Bridges; **Interpretation** is safer than forced substitution.
5. **Row under‑protected.** If a row’s scope exceeds the weakest Bridge, either **split the row** by Context or **downgrade scope** to Naming‑only.
6. **Bridge sprawl.** Consolidate near‑duplicates into one Bridge with richer **Loss Notes**; retire the rest.
