## 2 · Problem frame

Naming errors cause structural errors:

1. **Context denial.** A label hides its Context, inviting Cross‑context misuse (*“process”* used for both BPMN and PROV senses).
2. **senseFamily blur.** Names conflate **Role** (behavioural mask) with **Status** (epistemic/deontic badge).
3. **Over‑reach.** U.Types inherit jargon from one canon and sound global while being parochial.
4. **Under-reach.** Role Description labels sound so generic that they pretend to be U.Types.
5. **Unstable synonyms.** Labels drift to placate readers rather than reflect meaning fixed in SenseCells.

This code resolves these by **Context fidelity**, **senseFamily‑aware morphology**, and **two‑register pedagogy**.
