## A.3.3 · `U.Dynamics` \[D]

### 1 · Context

Teams need one place to say **how a thing changes**. Physicists call this “dynamics” (equations of motion, state‑transition maps). In IT and enterprise change, we often talk about **evolution of characteristics** (latency, cost, reliability, compliance, architectural fitness) across time. In knowledge work, **KD‑CAL** (knowledge dynamics) reasons about how the **status of claims** shifts as evidence arrives. All these are *the same modeling need*: a context‑local description of **state space** and **allowed transitions**.

FPF already separates:

* **what a holon is** (structure, PBS/SBS),
* **how we act** (Method/MethodDescription, Work),
* **what we promise** (Service).

What is missing without `U.Dynamics` is the **law of change**—the model that tells us how states evolve **with or without** our interventions.

> Intuition: **Method** tells an agent what to do; **Dynamics** tells everyone how the world (or a model of it) changes when something happens (or even when nothing happens).

**Lexical note.** Terms like *process* and *thermodynamic process* are mapped by **L‑PROC**:

* the **recipe** is `U.Method/MethodDescription`,
* the **dated run** is `U.Work`,
* the **law/trajectory model** is `U.Dynamics`.

### 2 · Problem

Without a first‑class `U.Dynamics`, models suffer predictable failures:

1. **Recipe = Law.** Teams put the *procedure* (Method/MethodDescription) where the *state law* should be, so simulations and predictions become impossible to compare with reality.
2. **Run = Law.** Logs of Work are mistaken for dynamics; past events are treated as if they defined what *must* happen.
3. **No state space.** Discussions jump between metrics (latency! throughput!) without an explicit **characteristic space** or invariants, so “improvements” cannot be reasoned about.
4. **Domain lock‑in.** “Dynamics” is left to domain vocabularies (physics, control, finance), losing a trans‑disciplinary way to speak about change in a single kernel.

| **Model vs. reality**                  | A law must be **design‑time** (an `Episteme`), yet judged by **run‑time** evidence (Work).                              |
| **Continuous vs. discrete vs. hybrid** | Different time bases and update rules must coexist.                                                                     |
| **Open vs. closed systems**            | Exogenous inputs (control/disturbances) may be explicit or implicit.                                                    |
| **Predictive use vs. diagnostic use**  | The same dynamics can guide planning or explain incidents; interfaces must support both.                                |

### 4 · Solution — The unified concept `U.Dynamics`

**Definition (normative).**
Within a `U.BoundedContext`, **`U.Dynamics`** is an **`U.Episteme` that specifies a state space and a state‑transition law** (deterministic or stochastic, continuous/discrete/hybrid) for one or more holons, possibly under exogenous inputs and constraints. It **does not** prescribe what an agent should do (that is `U.Method/MethodDescription`) and **is not** the dated evolution itself (that is `U.Work` evidence).

* **Type:** `U.Episteme` (design‑time model/law on a carrier).
* **Orientation:** descriptive/predictive about **how states evolve**; can be used by Methods but remains separate from them.
* **Judged by:** conformance of observed **Work‑derived traces** to the law and invariants.

#### 4.1 · Core structure (minimal fields)

```
U.Dynamics {
  context        : U.BoundedContext,     // where the model’s meaning and units are defined
  stateSpace     : CharacteristicSpace,  // explicit characteristics & units; may include topology/geometry
  transitionLaw  : Episteme,             // equations/relations/kernels/transition matrices/rules
  timeBase       : {continuous|discrete|hybrid},
  stochasticity? : {deterministic|stochastic}, // incl. noise/likelihood model if stochastic
  inputs?        : P(Characteristic),    // control/disturbances/environmental drivers
  observation?   : Episteme,             // measurement/observation map from state to observables
  constraints?   : Episteme,             // invariants/safety envelopes/guards
  validity?      : Conditions,           // operating region, approximations, version, timespan
  calibration?   : Episteme              // parameter identification / priors
}
```

* **`stateSpace`** uses FPF **characteristics** (not “characteristics”) so we can talk about **architecture fitness** (e.g., latency, MTBF, cost) just like temperature/pressure/volume in physics.
* **`transitionLaw`** is paradigm‑agnostic: ODE/PDE, finite‑state relation, Petri net firing, queueing kernel, Bayesian update, etc.
* **`observation`** separates what exists from what we *measure* (key for monitoring/assurance).

#### 4.2 · What `U.Dynamics` is **not**

* **Not a Method/MethodDescription:** no imperative steps or prescriptions.
* **Not Work:** no timestamps/resources attached; evidence lives on `U.Work`.
* **Not a Service:** no consumer promise; dynamics may underpin service SLOs but does not define the promise.
* **Not PBS/SBS:** do not place dynamics inside structural BoMs.

### 5 · Where `U.Dynamics` sits in enactment

* **Design‑time:**
  Methods may *reference* Dynamics for planning/control (e.g., MPC uses a plant model).
  Services may *derive* acceptance targets from Dynamics (e.g., queueing predictions → SLO).

* **Run‑time:**
  Work produces **state samples/telemetry**; applying the **observation** map yields traces.
  Conformance/violation is decided by comparing traces with **constraints** and predictions from the transition law.
  Updates to model parameters flow via **calibration** (design‑time again).

> Memory hook: **Method decides**, **Dynamics predicts**, **Work reveals**.

### Prediction Use In Gating (normative)

When **predicted** coordinates (from a dynamics model) are used for **comparison or gating**, one of the following **MUST** hold:
1) a **fresh observation** is available for the gate’s window; or
2) the applied flow/map `Φ_{Δt}` is proven **non‑expansive** (Lipschitz ≤ 1) under the declared distance overlay (see § 5.1.7), **and** it **commutes** with the invariantization step (§ 5.1.6) — i.e., `Quot/Fix_g ∘ Φ_{Δt} = Φ_{Δt} ∘ Quot/Fix_g` on the domain of use.

If neither condition is satisfied, using prediction for gating is **forbidden**; the system **MUST** fall back to observation. Any use of `Φ_{Δt}` **SHALL** declare its validity window (range, Δt).

| **Process control**           | Reactor: {Temperature, Concentration}   | Non‑linear ODE with disturbance term | Thermocouples, analyzers    | Will we overshoot? What control horizon keeps safety constraints? |
| **Reliability/ops**           | Service platform: {MTBF, MTTR, Backlog} | Birth–death/queueing model           | Incident logs, uptime pings | Given load, what SLO is feasible?                                 |
| **Evolutionary architecture** | System: {Latency, Cost, Coupling}       | Discrete‑time map per release        | Perf tests, bills           | If we change X, how does latency trend next 3 sprints?            |
| **KD‑CAL (knowledge)**        | Claim: {Belief, Support}                | Bayesian update rule                 | Evidence artifacts          | How does confidence evolve as studies arrive?                     |

**Key takeaway:** one kernel object captures **trajectories in a characteristic space**, from thermodynamics to software quality and knowledge confidence.
