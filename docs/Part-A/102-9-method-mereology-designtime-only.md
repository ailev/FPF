## 9 · Method mereology (composition) — design‑time only

**Operators (conceptual, context‑scoped):**

* **Serial composition (`·`)** — do A then B → `A · B` is a new Method.
* **Parallel composition (`‖`)** — do A and B concurrently (with declared independence/joins).
* **Choice (`|`)** — do **one** of {A, B} under guard/selector.
* **Iteration (`*`)** — repeat A under a loop invariant/termination condition.
* **Refinement (`≤ₘ`)** — Method M' preserves M’s interface/effects and **strengthens** preconditions or **tightens** non‑functional bounds (context‑defined lattice).
* **Substitution** — replace a Method factor with a semantically equivalent one (`M ≡ N` in context) without changing the whole’s Standard.

**Design‑time laws (intuitive, not mechanized here):**

* Associativity for `·` and, where admissible, for `‖`.
* Distributivity over guarded choice under context rules.
* Identity elements (e.g., `Skip` that preserves state and satisfies neutral bounds).
* Monotonicity: refinement of a factor **should not** break the whole’s postconditions.

**Run‑time mapping (do not conflate):**
`U.Work` instances of `A · B` **may** interleave differently due to scheduling or failure‑handling and still be executions of `A · B`. The mapping is “execution semantics,” not part of Method mereology.
