## 3 · Forces (what we must balance)

| Force                              | Tension we resolve                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Representation vs. semantics**   | Many notations, one meaning: specs may differ, method stays one.                                    |
| **Universality vs. domain idioms** | SOPs, code, solver models, proofs—all first‑class, yet domain terms remain local.                   |
| **Timelessness vs. operability**   | Specs are timeless, but must be precise enough to drive execution and audit.                        |
| **Reusability vs. constraints**    | Specs should declare role kinds, capabilities, safety bounds—without baking in people or calendars. |
| **Evolvability vs. identity**      | Specs change; we need a way to evolve them without losing the method’s identity or history.         |
