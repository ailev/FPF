## 15 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Refactor long tutorials.** Extract the **claim**; pick **3–6 Contexts** (Cards); list the **SenseCells** you actually use; craft **one tight row**; surface any cross‑talk as **Bridges** with loss notes; delete everything else.
2. **Split crowded rows.** If a row tries to carry more than \~4 cells, split into two rows and write a **one‑line purpose** for each.
3. **Stabilise vocabulary.** If you find yourself rewriting terms mid‑page, you likely forgot a Context; return to F.1 and add a Card.
4. **Teach the bridge itch.** Leave “*these are the same*” feelings ungratified until you can articulate **kind, CL, loss** in one sentence.
5. **DesignRunTag respect.** If a design‑only Context tempts you into runtime talk, move that part of the narrative into a **run‑Context** and Bridge as needed.
6. **Keep the page living.** When upstream rows/bridges evolve (F.7–F.9), adjust the page *minimally* and call out the change in a margin note (conceptual, not procedural).
