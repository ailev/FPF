> “Before you name anything, **fix the context of meaning**. A *Context* is a **U.BoundedContext** tied to a specific canon—*BPMN 2.0*, *PROV‑O*, *ITIL 4*, *SOSA/SSN*, *IEC 61131‑3*, *OWL 2*. Words are **local to Contexts**: *process (BPMN)* is a workflow graph, *activity (PROV)* is a run‑time occurrence, *service (ITIL)* is a promise vocabulary. Cut the landscape so each unification line sees **at least three domain families**, with **one‑screen Cards** per Context (scope gist, time stance, trip‑wires). **Do not bridge** Contexts here—just write down the itch to bridge and defer it. Keep the cut **small enough to remember**. With Contexts fixed, harvesting (F.2), local clustering (F.3), role/status templates (F.4), and explicit Cross‑context bridges (F.9) become straightforward—and you avoid naming ghosts that come from words floating without walls.”
