## 5.6 · Acceptance (conceptual, RSG‑aware)

> Acceptance here is **thought‑level**. It uses the **Reachable‑States Graph (A.2.5)** pattern to organise mental checks—no “lifecycle” narratives.

**SCR‑C16‑A (Template sufficiency).** You can traverse **N1→N3** (Characteristic fixed → Scale typed → Unit coherent) for the template **without** invoking any implementation artifacts (cf. A.18 RSG alignment).

**SCR‑C16‑B (Reading sufficiency).** For a given subject, you can traverse **N4→N6** (Gauge named where needed → exemplar‑anchored sense → reading established) with polarity and arity explicit.

**SCR‑C16‑C (Comparability).** When two readings are placed side‑by‑side, you can state in one breath whether they are **comparable as‑is** or only **after 𝒢**, and **why**.

**SCR‑C16‑D (Evidence adequacy).** For any required EvidenceStub, you can sketch at least one **auditable chain of grounds** from the subject to the Characteristic via a Description in the right Context.

### 5.7 Cross‑references & anchors

* **A.17 (CHR‑NORM).** Canonical **Characteristic** and Entity/Relation split; lexical rules and alias sunset.
* **A.18 (CSLC‑KERNEL).** One Characteristic + one Scale per template; Level optional; operation guard by scale type.
* **Annex C (old MM‑CHR).** Cross‑domain alignment hints for Characteristics/Observations/Quantities across ISO 80000, ISO/IEC 25024, QUDT, SOSA/SSN (used here only as conceptual witnesses).
