> “When you talk about *how something is done*, decide which of the **four boxes** you mean.
> **Method** is the **idea** (the way). **MethodDescription** is the **recipe** (the description). **Work** is the **happening** (what actually occurred). **Actuation** is the **control push** (signals emitted during Work).
> Keep **design** and **run** as distinct **stances**. Plans and approvals live in the **design stance**; measurements and obligations live in the **run stance** within **Windows**.
> Words like *process*, *task*, *activity*, *command* are **context‑local**—say *process (BPMN)*, *activity (PROV)*, *task (IEC)*. If you must relate them, draw a **Bridge** and declare its **kind**, **CL**, and **Loss**.
> For compliance, don’t point at the plan—point at **Work**, show **Observations**, and judge clauses in **F.10**.
> Hold this quartet in your head and you’ll stop mixing plans with facts, signals with outcomes, and names across Contexts. + Everything else—naming (F.5), `U.RoleDescription` (F.4) and `U.RoleAssignment`/`U.RoleEnactment` (A.2.1/F.6), Bridges (F.7/F.9)—falls into place.
