| **Locality vs reuse**           | Senses are context‑local, yet people need a common label to talk across Contexts.              |
| **Simplicity vs fidelity**      | Few Bridge kinds are teachable; too few will hide real mismatches.                       |
| **Safety vs utility**           | Allow some substitution when safe; forbid it when loss is unbounded.                     |
| **senseFamily purity vs explanation** | Substitution must preserve **senseFamily**; explanation may span **senseFamilies** without implying sameness. |
