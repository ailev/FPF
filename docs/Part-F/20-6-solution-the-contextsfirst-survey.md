## 6 · Solution — the Contexts‑first survey (conceptual, notation‑free)

**Step 1 — Declare your unification line(s).**
State which architheory threads are in play (e.g., *Enactment + KD‑CAL sensing + Sys‑CAL execution*). This keeps the cut purposeful.

**Step 2 — Cut the landscape by domain families.**
For each line, **select at least three distinct domain families** (heterogeneity guard). Examples:

* *Workflow & provenance* (BPMN 2.0; W3C PROV‑O)
* *Services & deontics* (ITIL 4; ODRL 2.2)
* *Sensing & measurement* (SOSA/SSN; ISO 80000‑1)
* *Types & taxonomies* (OWL 2; FCA corpus)
* *Control & actuation* (state‑space control texts; IEC 61131‑3)

**Step 3 — For each family, sketch 1–3 Context Cards.**
Prefer canonical, widely cited canons. If a field is fragmented, choose one **exemplar** and one **counter‑voice** to surface heterogeneity.

**Step 4 — Make **locality** explicit.**
Treat words as **context‑local**. *Process (BPMN)* ≠ *process (thermodynamics)* ≠ *process (PROV)*. Do not reconcile. Do not average. **Just fix the Contexts.**

**Step 5 — Bound the set.**
Small enough to hold in working memory. As a rule of thumb:

* per unification line: **≥ 3 families**;
* per family: **1–3 Contexts**.
  More only if a missing Context hides a known sense‑split you will certainly need.

**Step 6 — Postpone bridges.**
If two Contexts seem “close”, **resist** collapsing. Note the tension and defer to **F.9 Alignment & Bridge**.
