| Force                                    | Tension to resolve                                                                              |

| **Minimal disclosure vs precision**      | Bridges must be light to write yet precise enough to avoid semantic drift.                      |
| **Local autonomy vs global reuse**       | Each target‑context keeps its vocabulary; reuse requires explicit, reviewable mappings.                   |
| **Typed safety vs agility**              | We need typed compatibility checks without blocking exploratory reuse.                          |
| **Separate channels vs operator burden** | Two channels (Scope & Kind) must be explicit, but guard writers shouldn’t drown in boilerplate. |
