## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **small, normative code of naming** so that **U.Types** (Cross‑context categories) and **Role Descriptions** (context‑local Roles/Statuses) are labelled **clearly, locally faithful, and globally stable**, without importing tooling, workflows, or editorial process. Names are **consequences of meaning** fixed earlier (F.1–F.4), not badges invented to “stabilise” drifting words.

**Applicability.** Use **whenever** you (a) mint or revise a **U.Type** name from a **Concept‑Set row** (F.7), or (b) assign labels to a **Role Description** (F.4). This pattern governs **what a good name must be**, not *how a team produces it*.

**Non‑goals.** No registries, reviews, or hand‑offs. No style‑police for punctuation beyond conceptual clarity. No bridging or synonym decisions across Contexts (F.9 does that).
