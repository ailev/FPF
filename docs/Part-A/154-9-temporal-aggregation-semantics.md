## 9 · Temporal & Aggregation Semantics (normative operators & invariants)

### 9.1 Temporal coverage `Γ_time`

* **Input:** a finite set `S` of Work instances or Work parts.
* **Output:** either (a) the **union** of their intervals, or (b) the **convex hull** `[min t_start, max t_end]`—**as declared by context** and KPI.
* **Invariants:**

  * **Idempotent:** `Γ_time(S ∪ S) = Γ_time(S)`
  * **Commutative:** order of elements irrelevant
  * **Monotone:** if `S ⊆ T` then coverage(S) ⊆ coverage(T) (for union) or hull(S) ⊆ hull(T) (for hull)
* **Usage guidance:**

  * Use **union** for **utilization/availability** (how much of the clock time the asset was actually busy).
  * Use **hull** for **lead/cycle time** (elapsed from first touch to last release).
  * **Manager’s tip:** Write the choice near the KPI; many disputes are just a hidden union‑vs‑hull mismatch.

### 9.2 Resource aggregation `Γ_work`

* **Input:** a finite set `S` of Work instances or parts with resource ledgers.
* **Output:** an **aggregated ledger** (materials, energy, machine‑time, money, tool wear) with explicit **overlap policy**.
* **Invariants:**

  * **Additivity on disjoint parts:** if intervals/resources are disjoint by policy, totals add.
  * **No double‑count:** overlapping costs must follow the declared policy (e.g., count once at parent).
  * **Traceability:** each aggregated figure must be reconcilable to contributing Work IDs.
* **Typical policies:**

  * **Parent‑attribution:** shared fixed costs at parent; variable costs at children.
  * **Pro‑rata by wall‑time:** split overlaps by relative durations.
  * **Driver‑based:** allocate by a declared driver (e.g., CPU share, weight, priority).
