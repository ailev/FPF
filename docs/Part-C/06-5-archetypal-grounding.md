## 5 · ✱ Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

**Universal rule (tell).** *Compose knowledge by Γ\_epist with weakest‑link R, monotone F, and explicit CL on every bridge; keep Symbol–Concept–Object separate and never turn a carrier into a part.*

**System (show, Sys‑CAL lens).** Consider a **battery‑pack thermal subsystem** integrating a physics model of heat flow and an operating envelope for fast‑charge. As a **system**, it composes pumps, sensors, and controllers by physical Γ with conservation constraints (Sys‑CAL). The assurance story depends on epistemes about the model and envelope; the system **acts**, epistemes constrain. (Archetypes and boundary discipline per core.)

**Episteme (show, KD‑CAL lens).** Consider a **CMIP‑class climate projection episteme** (post‑2015 generation): its **Concept** is a claim‑graph over PDEs and parameterisations; its **Object** defines an claim scope (historical forcings, resolution); its **Symbol** may include two notations (domain equations vs. tabular schema) linked by a **NotationBridge** with an explicit CL. Compose sub‑epistemes for radiation, clouds, and ocean mixing: `R = min` across the critical path; an independent hindcast line can raise `R` only up to its own level; `F` is bounded by the least‑formal sub‑claim unless the composition adds formal invariants.
